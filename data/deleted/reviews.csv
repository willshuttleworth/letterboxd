What’s not to love about Jurassic Park? I’m not a huge fan of dinosaurs, but I am a fan of huge dinosaurs. This movie does and will always hold a special place in my heart. Not only was seeing this movie in theaters my parents first date, but is also one of the first memories of absolutely loving a movie. This was my absolute favorite for probably a good 5 years, and has good reason being so. The special effects, the action and the score are all big factors in making this such an iconic flick.",,2019-11-28

This movie made my Mother cry, which was something I thought only I had the power to do. For solely that reason, this movie has earned 2.5 stars. I don’t like this movie.

At surface level, My Spy is a funny, entertaining, and well-acted movie. However, as soon as you start to think about the details and what's exactly going on, it crumbles apart faster than a Nature's Valley granola bar. What My Spy really is, is a pervert-y awkward comedy that has far too many potholes and seems to appeal to a very niche audience. Thankfully, the majority of those problems disappear after the first act, and while more problems (this time more focused on plot) arise, the movie as a whole levels out and ends up being not too shabby. Points are given to the surprisingly great performances by Chloe Colemen and Dave Bautista, the Iron Man 2/Mission Impossible/Shrek/Indiana Jones references, and the few jokes that admittedly did make me laugh.",,

2021-01-07,Big Mouth,2012,https://boxd.it/1ziSK7,,,"Show average: 3 stars, 69/100 

I'm not attaching a star rating to this review since I haven't seen the short film and don't want to tamper with the average rating. If you haven't realized by now, I'm reviewing the Netflix TV show of the same name. I'll come back and edit this review after each season I watch.

Season 1 (3.5 Stars, 73/100)

A star-studded cast but a lackluster start. Apparently, Kroll's intention with this show was to make kids feel more comfortable with their bodies and to not be ashamed that they're late bloomers. In my opinion, this show didn't accomplish either of those things. The show is far too vulgar for kids the age of the characters to watch, and it touched very minutely on the topic of late bloomers. I was a late bloomer myself and it was one of my biggest insecurities all through middle school and the beginning of high school. Which, I can tell you right now, I don't think this show would have helped with that. I also feel like this show tried a little too hard to be like Family Guy. Obviously, when creating an animated tv show, you gotta look up to shows like that but I feel like it's a little on the nose. The cutaways, the super meta fourth wall breaks, etc. Not to mention the creator of both shows voice a majority of the characters. Speaking of which, apart from a few of the series regulars, Nick Kroll's voice acting is a little too similar for a lot of the characters. I feel like he has too unique of a voice to be able to voice so many characters; he's too recognizable and it instantly takes me out of the show. Overall, I did enjoy it. There were a lot of extremely vulgar parts that made me uncomfortable but it also had a lot of good laughs and was enjoyable enough that I'll continue watching the later seasons.

Season 2 (3.5 Stars, 75/100)

A weak start, a strong middle, and a weak end. Thankfully, they actually started to accomplish their goal of the show this season. Instead of being grotesque and perverted for the sake of being grotesque and perverted (apart from episode two and the end of episode eight), they did so in order to teach a lesson or be educational. I liked how real Jessi's arc was, it was probably my favorite part of the season. A lot of my basic grievances still carry over from season one, but I did like this season better.

Season 3 (3 Stars, 67/100)

This season brought back the problems I had with the first season, and the laughable jokes were much more scarce as well. I feel like this season didn't have an overall storyline as the previous two did. A little something happened each episode but didn't really have an effect on the show as a whole and resolved itself by the end. I'm going to finish the last season since I've already gotten this far, but I'm not going to be happy about it. It's beginning to feel formulaic and boring and I'm having trouble enjoying myself while watching.

Season 4 (3 stars, 64/100)

This season made watching this show seem more like a chore than enjoying it like the previous seasons. The only thing this show did for me was made me feel bad about my sex life (or lack thereof).","w/ myself, @ home, netflix, haven't seen",
2021-01-13,No Half Measures: Creating the Final Season of Breaking Bad,2013,https://boxd.it/1AffOd,,,"I won't attach a star rating to this until I've seen the actual documentary, but I will be using this review to review the show. I watched through season 3 about a year and a half ago but never got around to finishing it, so this go-around is both a rewatch and a watch through at the same time. I'll update this review each time I finish a new season, and I'll publish a second review once I watch the actual documentary this entry is for.

Season One (4 stars, 83/100)

A strong start to the series, and I'm excited to keep watching. The final episode was a little weak in terms of a conclusion but it was a great season nonetheless. Some of the tension wasn't there as I already knew what was going to happen, which will, unfortunately, being a reoccurring thing as I continue watching the parts I've already seen. Bryan Cranston is an outstanding actor and is crazy good in this role. Time to start season 2.

Season Two (4 stars, 84/100)

I just finished season two in about two days; Breaking Bad is like blue sky to me. Season two started out strong but slowly dwindled down as the season went on. My favorite episode of the show so far, Grilled, was nothing short of amazing. Some other notable moments are 4 Days Out, Walter giving Walter Jr. the tequila, the introduction of Gus, Hank as a whole, Skyler revealing she knows Walt has a second phone, etc. On the downside, I feel like a few plot holes came up throughout the season that really brought the show down for me. Another thing I didn't like was how unsatisfying the ""big reveal"" of the plane crash was at the end of the season. They build it up as this huge mysterious thing and then reveal it all in like 5 minutes. Something else was the therapist that they introduced in season one that never appeared again. They set him up to be an important character but he was never seen or referenced in the second season. Besides that, this season was pretty good and I can't wait to start season 3.

Season 3 (4 stars, 84/100)

Right off the bat, I hate how poorly this season built off the finale of the second one. They almost never reference the airplane crash again after the first episode, and the dad isn't even seen once. I also feel like the relationship between Walt and Jessie got a little repetitive in the beginning. Besides that, this season wasn't too bad. It had a really strong back half and included two of my favorite episodes, Sunset and Fly.

Season 4 (4 stars, 85/100)

Season 4 is my favorite so far, but it doesn't go without its flaws. I feel like Hank should've been a little more suspicious of Walter after all that he's done, especially after the car crash. I also feel like Hank's recovery was a little quick. I mean realistically I don't think you'd be able to recover from 4 gunshots in the span of a couple of months. Perhaps I'm just nitpicking, but it's just something that stood out to me. One thing I did like was the overall plot of this season. The relationship between Walter, Jessie, and Gus was super interesting and was the main reason I continued to watch. Speaking of Gus, his death, while a little unrealistic, was nuts. I love seeing him get mad, it feels so raw and unhinged, and seeing him die the way he did was both satisfying and crazy cool. If it only gets better from here, I eagerly await my finishing of season five.","w/ myself, @ home, netflix",
2021-01-16,WandaVision,2021,https://boxd.it/1AFHpR,,,"I'll update this review each week as the new episodes come out, then at the end, I'll average the ratings of all the episodes and attach a star rating accordingly.

Episode One (3 Stars, 64/100) 7

A lackluster and uninteresting start to the show. I know it wasn't meant to be this way, but this is the first piece of MCU content we've gotten since Spider-man: Far From Home all the way back in July 2019, so my expectations were a bit high for this. I appreciate they're staying true to the style of television they're replicating, but it would've been cool if they did it on film, too. This episode was painfully mediocre, so hopefully, they only get better from here. Oh, and it's pretty annoying how the credits are 7 minutes long with no post-credit scene. It really throws off the runtime and made me waste a couple of minutes thinking there was something to be waiting for.

Episode Two (3 stars, 66/100) 6

This episode really isn't any better than the last one; a lot of my complaints still stand. The only good parts were the little bits where the outside reality started to poke in and Wanda breaks character for a second. I also like how when Wanda tried to tell Vision about it, the laugh track played, almost as if the world that they're living in is trying to devalue their discovery or something. I'm excited for next week, I'm optimistic that it does get better, hopefully by exploring all the S.W.O.R.D. stuff we saw in the trailers.

Episode Three (3 stars, 61/100) 8

As much as I enjoyed finally getting a glimpse at the outside world and see the reality start to crack, this is my least favorite episode yet. The writing and acting were not very good in my opinion, and it was hard for me to find myself invested in what was happening. I'm not used to watching TV shows, let alone TV shows from this era, so perhaps I'm missing some perspective when it comes to this TV show. It's nice to see Marvel doing something different from the usual shenanigans in their movies, but in my opinion, it isn't really working out. Oh, and it annoyed the absolute crap out of me that one of Vision's collars was untucked the whole episode. How does that happen for the entire episode? Did they film this in a day? Maybe I'm missing a reference or something but I could not take my eyes off that every time he came on screen.

Episode Four (4 Stars, 82/100) 1

Finally something interesting! This episode acted as a behind the scenes for the previous three which was a really fresh idea. The opening was super cool to see as I always love world-building like that, plus the blip wasn't something we saw a whole lot of besides some iPhone footage in Far From Home. I think my favorite scene from the whole episode though is watching the television correct itself for Kat and Jimmy, then cutting to see what we missed the last episode due to the cut. Plus that shot of dead Vision was crazy cool and it makes me wonder if Wanda is actually using his dead body as a puppet or something. Imagine if at the end once that's revealed we go back and rewatch old scenes only it's Vision's dead body and Wanda is playing with it like a doll. One critique would be that this episode does kind of ruin the ambiguity and momentum the show had going for it so far, but I feel like it was necessary for the progression for the show. I'm really excited moving forward now; this show has proven that it's unlike anything Marvel has done before, plus it seems like we're only getting started in terms of how cool this show is going to get. You've got my attention now!

Episode 5 (3.5 Stars, 78/100) 1

HolyshitholyshitholyshitholyshitholyshitHOLYSHIT! That last scene literally had my jaw on the floor. I'm crazy excited to see how this plays out, and whether they'll have him back as a reoccurring character or not once this is all over. With the recent spidey news, I'm curious how Marvel explains this. Alternate universe? Coincidence they look the same? Whatever it is, I'm all for it as long as it's a neat explanation. Also, Agnes is really starting to act suspicious... I'm not entirely sure she didn't kill that dog herself...

Episode 6 (3.5 Stars, 76/100) 3

I have no idea where this is going lmao. All of my theories have turned belly up. Also that Kick-Ass joke was meta as fuck.

Episode 7 (3 Stars, 68/100) 4

The actual meat of the episode was pretty boring but those last five minutes and the post-credit scene were nuts. I swear this show makes time fly like no other.

Episode 8 (3.5 Stars, 78/100) 2

I really enjoyed this episode because it revealed everything we've been wanting to know but I also didn't like this episode because it revealed everything we've wanted to know. All of the tension and ambiguity is gone as this episode pulled the curtain on every mystery we've been presented with from the first 7 episodes, only leaving behind the questions this episode posed to be answered in the finale. Wanda's backstory was fun to see but it didn't really add any new information to what we already knew about it. I'm interested to see how this ends and what ""the big cameo"" is, even though I'm 99% positive it's Doctor Strange. This will be the last episode I review on this entry as I'm going to rewatch the entire show and write all new reviews in preparation for the finale.","w/ myself, @ home, @ school, disney+",

Movies are supposed to be an escape from the world the viewer is apart of and allow them to be apart of something more. So, in my opinion, making a movie about the most popular thing people have been struggling with over the past 11 months was not the move. Not to mention this movie doesn't offer any type of reliability to the situation. The plot revolves around two millionaire business owners whose only hardships are not being able to leave their houses. I got about 35 minutes into this movie before turning it off, and absolutely nothing had happened so far. Just a bunch of zoom calls and dialogue between characters I couldn't give a shit about. I don't ever want to see a facemask or a zoom call inside a movie ever again. Fuck this movie and everyone who was apart of it.",haven't seen,

Already, I like this better than Wandavision. The individual storylines for Bucky and Sam are both really strong. I love the look into Bucky's mental health and how he's still recovering from hydra's brainwashing. I like Sam's storyline because it's much more personal. I like that Marvel is using these shows to take a break from the action and explosions to tell smaller stories and ones that can hit a little closer to home. I think where this episode falls short is in the action. Physics doesn't really matter in this show and the choreography falls a bit short. Not to mention the editing, which was pretty weak as well. I'm excited to see where this show goes. It seems pretty grounded which is nice. Bucky is one of the better characters in the MCU just from a storytelling standpoint so I'm glad they're fully utilizing him here.","w/ myself, @ school, disney+",

Episode Two (3.5 Stars, 71/100)

I keep seeing a ton of reviews bashing John Walker, but in all honesty, he might be my favorite character. He actually has depth as a character, his writing is decent, and Wyatt Russel is doing a stupendous job playing him. I got huge Homelander vibes from his performance which is 100% a great thing. I first noticed it last episode, and it still occurred in this episode, but the editing is really off. Fight scenes are confusing and even simple dialogue scenes are jarring and off-putting. I was disappointed to see that Sam did not continue his family storyline this episode as I loved it in the first one. I enjoy where the show is taking him now, but I hope they revisit that eventually. Another thing I like that they're exploring in the show is the cop stereotype. It was cool to see them go from hostile to fanboys after realizing who Sam was. This show is pretty decent, and I'm looking forward to episode 3.","w/ myself, @ home, @ school, disney+",

Episode Three (3 Stars, 68/100)

Pretty lackluster in terms of story. I wasn't a huge fan of Zemo being royalty bc it felt so tacked on and was just an easy writing scapegoat for how the characters would get the equipment they needed. There were reports around summer of last year that they had to do reshoots due to a subplot revolving around a virus. That was pretty apparent here. A bunch of lines from different characters had different audio quality than the rest of the conversation, a lot of lines were delivered while faces were out of frame, etc. I'm sure they tried their best given the circumstances but the patch job was pretty messy and very noticeable in my opinion. Sharon's character did a full 180 since we last saw her and I'm curious where they're going with that. As of right now, she and John Walker are the only two characters I care about right now.

I feel like every new Marvel TV show or movie gets messier and messier with their plot hole explanations. With Loki, it's explaining why we're only seeing the TVA now as well as all of that timeline mumbo jumbo. The first episode was enjoyable. A lot of fun stylistically and I love the colors and soundtrack. I was hoping the D.B. Cooper thing would be bigger than it actually was, so I was a little disappointed there. This show looks promising! I know that's what I said about the last two Disney+ Marvel shows which both ended up being a little disappointing but maybe this will be different? I'm cautiously optimistic.

Episode Two (3.5 Stars, 75/100)

I feel like this show is really starting to find its stride, this episode rocks. The whole roxxcart scene was done really well, some of my favorite of the Marvel stuff we've gotten on Disney+ so far. I think the song choice in the open was a little off but maybe it's setting up something later so I won't be too harsh on it yet. I think the less you think about how the TVA operates the more the show makes sense.

Episode Three (3 Stars, 60/100)

I feel like it was unfair watching this episode after last weeks considering how good that one was and how mundane this one was but I don't know any other way to watch these other than chronological order so here we are. There were a lot of story points that seemed useless and the fact that it ended in a cliffhanger meaning there will be more of this next week does not excite me in the least. Very boring. Cool colors.

Episode Four (3.5 Stars, 72/100)

A lot of fun. They already said Loki was bisexual, it would've been cool to see him pursue a man imo.

Episode Five (3.5 Stars, 77/100)

My favorite episode yet. I felt like Mobius' goodbye and old Loki's death were a little rushed and awkward. Had tons of fun picking out all of the easter eggs.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",

The acting is stiff and the writing is awkward. The opening scene was cool but I'm unimpressed so far.

Episode Two (3 Stars) - 4

I like the idea of a murder mystery but it's not very well done thus far. The script feels like a rough draft.

Episode Three (3 1/2 Stars) - 1

There was less dependence on dialogue and performances, eliminating my issues with the first two episodes leaving me to actually enjoy this one. The action scenes were fun and well-choreographed. Kingpin!

Episode Four (3 1/2 Stars) - 2

I loved the little relationship-building moment between Clint and Kate to Mele Kalikimaka. Some of the line delivery from the background characters was a little awkward, but that's my only complaint about this episode. I hope we see more of Yelena than what we saw of her here. Bert and Bertie clearly know what they're doing, the two episodes they've directed are my two favorite episodes Disney+ has put out for Marvel so far. Hopefully, they're handling the rest of the series.

Yelena is annoying. More Kingpin!","w/ myself, disney+, @ mu",

I’m not gonna assign a star rating until I see volume two but consider me unimpressed as of right now. I liked the anime part, but I think that just means I need to watch more anime. The first 15 minutes were good! Not much else.","@ pitt, w/ will, w/ john, w/ jack n, w/ kelcey, w/ jamie, w/ bob, w/ ben, w/ shivani, w/ emily, w/ zayd, w/ partheev",2022-03-28
