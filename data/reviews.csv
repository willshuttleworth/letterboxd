While the opening shot ensures this movie takes place in the 1960s, the costumes and script matched the essence of present day. The horror promised by the book series was barely paid off. The closest thing to scary this movie provided was that it set up a sequel. Most of the presumed horror was made up of cheesy jump scares that, at most, made me shake my popcorn. Not to mention the horrible attempts at comedy made by whoever clown, sorry pierrot, that wrote this screenplay.","w/ kyle, @ theatre",2019-08-26

I avoided this movie after seeing the first reviews, but decided to go back to it this past weekend just to see what all the fuss was about. Wow were people wrong. This movie provided the music and feel good charm I needed. Sure, the editing and directing was a little off, but the great performances by the actors (especially Will Smith), along with the musical numbers made up for it entirely. I'll proudly be the first to say it, this movie was great.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",

This movie would’ve been much better if each of the characters had their own movie so we wouldn’t have to waste so much time introducing everyone. First off, the dialogue/acting was terrible. Flash had a few lines that hit right, but for the most part Ezra Miller delivered his “comedic relief” about the same a plank of wood. Affleck was given cheesy lines and you could tell he wasn’t bringing his A game. Cyborg came off forced, Ray Fischer showed off about the same emotions as an actual Cyborg. Diana and Arthur were the only two that I actually took an interest in, which is good as they’re the only two who actually have their own movies. There then of course is Superman. Why was he even in the movie? Oh, right. Money. They should’ve left him out anyhow as the $650 million this made in the box office was just a little low compared to the predicted $1.3 Billion it was supposed to make. Not to mention the terrible cgi, weak villain, underwhelming fight scene, forced references, plot holes, and so much more. Do yourself a favor and avoid the DCEU as a whole, they don’t get much better after this.","w/ myself, @ home, @ school, sparrow",2019-10-05

It baffles me how little attention this guy gets as a comedian. I saw one of his shows live a few years back and wasn't until this one popped up on my Youtube recommended page when I remembered what good of a time I had watching his other show. Laughing on Purpose does not disappoint in the slightest. Everything this guy said made me laugh, something that's pretty hard for a comedian to accomplish. I will not undergo another awkward interaction with a stranger without laughing thanks to this man.

Throughout my rewatch of Cars 2, I was continuously struck with bolts of nostalgia from my time as an 8/9-year-old kid. My brother and I loved this movie when we were younger, as we were obsessed with the spy genre and therefore this movie. If I were to rate this movie 8 years ago it would an easy 5 stars, which thankfully my rewatch today proves I've matured in at least my movie watching. I hadn't seen the first installment in a while and was surprised how different it was from its personally favored sequel. I get now why people enjoy the first Cars better, and to quote Adam Walenta, I understand the appeal. But with nostalgia in mind (as well as the continued interest in the spy genre) this movie still comes out on top.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",

As someone who isn't particularly interested in cars, and more specifically racing, I didn't find this movie all that interesting. I was often left confused when the plot relied on a racing term to make sense to the viewer or to deliver a punch line. This movie helps me appreciate what Pixar was trying to do back in the early days; making movies based on more obscure ideas. Don't get me wrong, I'm very excited for Soul and others of the like, but I miss the days where Pixar took risks and made movies based off of talking cars or societal monsters.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",

It's easy to be distracted by how beautiful the animation is in this movie when trying to rate it, but if you're able to get past it, you'll then realize how structureless this movie is. The story comes off as if you watched every other scene and have to figure out what happened in between on your own. It's hard to vocalize my exact opinions but long story short it isn't all that great.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",

I mentioned it in my Cars 3 review and I'll mention it here again, Pixar's animation as of late has been stunning, to say the least. However, it can't and won't make up for the lack of a good story.

Kingsman is quite possibly one of the best action movies ever made. Everything this movie has to offer is great.

Source Code Is a great idea executed poorly. Cutting back and fourth between the present and the source code was good in theory, but didn’t work the way the film wanted. I think something along the lines of the way The Edge of Tomorrow would have worked much better. The “twists” weren’t all that surprising and the acting was sub-par, even for Gyllenhaal’s standards.","w/ myself, @ school, sparrow",2019-11-27

Knives Out is your not-so-normal murder mystery. As a fan of the genre, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It was a bold choice to reveal the killer a mere 30 minutes in, a twist I didn’t expect in the slightest. I pride myself on my ability to predict the ending of a movie, Murder on the Orient Express being my most notable case, but Rian Johnson successfully kept me guessing throughout the entirety of the film. The film was only further enhanced with the stellar star-studded cast, everyone cast perfectly and bringing their A-game to the table. I don’t have much else to say except go see this movie, it’s Johnson’s best so far and one of my top pics for 2019.","w/dad, @ theatre",2019-12-01

Until the age of about 9 or 10, I was obsessed with trains. My grandfather and I would spend hours together by sitting by the train tracks near his house flattening pennies and gawking at the huge trains that would ride past us. My five-year-old birthday party was themed after the train company Canadian National, which I am probably the only child ever to have a birthday party based on a railway company. Long story short, I love trains, and for that reason, every movie to take place or have a scene set on a train automatically gets a better score out of me. This, plus the fact that I'm a sucker for suspense and cheesy action movies, is the cause for The Commuter earning a 3.5.","w/ myself, @ home, vod",

As a fan of Rain Johnson, I respect what he was trying to do with this movie. Sure, a few rewrites could instantly make this movie ten times better, but the movie we have now still has a lot of great things to offer: Snoke’s throne room, Crait, and Kylo Ren as a whole to name a few.

I'm going to start with this: I was disappointed by Rise of Skywalker. This movie did do some things I was a fan of; Oscar Isaac more involved in the story, Kylo Ren (as always), as well as some of the fan service they included. However, for this one, the bad far outways the good. For example; why bring back Palpatine? As a fan of TLJ, I think Rian's choice to make Rey a nobody, as well as a lot of the other things he did with his movie, was a nice touch. The return of Palpatine is a sloppy choice and raises plot holes and useless storylines within this movie that could've easily been avoided. This movie would've been much better if JJ were to just stick to what Rian had already done rather than try to damage control. This lead to pacing issues and useless characters. Besides Palpatine and the force, my biggest nitpick is death in this movie. I never felt like characters were in danger, and to be fair, they never were. None of the good guys besides Leia died, and if Carrie Fisher was still around, I don't think she would've either. If I were to change one thing, it'd be that Rey dies at the end, not Kylo. Another thing to complain about is the force. Much like Pym Particles in the Antman movies, it now doesn't have a defined existence but just does whatever the plot needs it to do and it comes off as lazy. I've been kind of all over the place with this review and its mostly because there's so much to say about this movie and I'm too tired to make it neat.",@ theatre,2019-12-22

Since Letterboxd only allows you to review movies, I’m going to use this documentary as a way to review the show, which by the way, is amazing. It’s disappointing how no one watched it when originally it came out, a statistic that sadly still applies today. I’ve never watched a show with more intricate writing and characters than this one. The humor makes me laugh harder than any show I’ve ever watched and makes me feel smart while doing it. Its untimely demise is unfortunate, and its Netflix revival doesn’t do the last 2 seasons any justice. To finish up my review I leave you with this: watch the first season of this show and if you don’t love it, you are soulless, and please feel free to pass away.","w/ myself, netflix, @ home",2019-12-22

I wonder why Damien Chazelle didn’t include Neil and Buzz discovering an Autobot warship on the moon in <i>First Man</i>. 

Nah but for real, while a nitpick for most I quite like the history retcons movies use sometimes as plot points. This movie, some of the X-men, and the National Treasures are all examples of this executed semi-well. Besides that minor detail of the movie, the rest is pretty much crap. Much like the rest of the movies in this franchise, it’s just your standard big robot does big CGI thing so Michael Bay can get his rocks off and move onto his next CGI ridden disasterpiece. The acting sucks, the story sucks, the directing sucks, the writing sucks, and so on and so fourth.","w/ myself, @ home, prime",2020-01-08

I'm confused as to how this movie genuinely scared me when I watched it today. The Fooglies and the Thumb minions triggered my fight or flight for some reason and I tense up when I think about them. I mean besides that, this movie is what I think of when I think of summers during my childhood. I remember watching either this movie or it's sequels at least twice a month and would never skip a viewing when Disney Channel had them on. This is my first movie of 2020, meaning its the first movie in my goal to watch one movie a day for a year straight. I'll come back and edit this review when I've either quit or when I've completed that challenge. Wish me luck.","w/ myself, @ home, netflix",2020-01-01

After watching Psych in its entirety in about 2 months during the summer of 2016, I was more than psyched (you know that's right) to find out they were doing a movie. I was so psyched, in fact, that I had to watch the entire series again. I've now seen this show 3 times all the way through (with a fourth rewatch coming up soon for that very anticipated Psych the movie 2) and I can confidently say this is my favorite TV Show of all time. Every line spoken in this show is delivered perfectly and never fails to make me laugh. I've hyped myself back up writing this review and so now, much like how Gus craves that buttery goodness, I crave this show.

3 stars are generous, so here's 2 and a half. This movie is repetitive and offers forgettable, low effort action. Not to mention the, for the most part, boring plot that oddly resembles that of Thor Ragnorak's. Acting is pretty bad, especially from Brie Larson, who I don't like in the first place. Writing is a bit shotty but often feels repetitive. I think it's worthy to note that the few jokes they include surprisingly land. The music choice is meh and the soundtrack is bland. They reveal a couple of major MCU mysteries in this film, which is all underwhelming for what they seemed to promise. I first saw this movie at the TCL Theatre in Hollywood when I took a weekend trip there with my Mother opening weekend. That I assume would be the reason why I enjoyed it a little more than I did this time.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-01-14

Before I get into this review, I want you to take a look at Peter Berg's Letterboxd page and tell me that he doesn't look like the top half of his face was borrowed from Michael Keaton and the bottom half borrowed from Daniel Stern. Anyhoo, I feel like this movie is one of those ones that was made to be shown on FX or FXX every Thursday night but since you're always busy on Thursday nights you ignore it only to eventually decide to record it and throw it on in the background while you're scrolling through social media. Just me? Okay. With all that aside, this movie wasn't the best. Besides a couple of cool action scenes, Hancock was made of an incoherent plot/storyline, awkward cinematography, and mediocre performances. Oh and Hancock? more like hand on my cock while watching this because... okay well no one in this movie is very attractive I just had to use that joke that I thought of while taking a bathroom break during one of the conversation scenes.

The story was nothing new, pretty much a rehash of every type of movie with this similar “explorer” style. Acting was just fine, nothing bad or good so I can’t complain there. A fun movie that I’d recommend to any other teenager who enjoys watching Isabella Merced run around in shorts and a crop top.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-02-07

This was a solid 3 stars until the third act rolled around. It seemed like they just wrote it on the fly and whatever the heck came out of their mouths is what they rolled with.

Made me cry more than I’m willing to admit. I’m willing to admit twice. Besides that, this movie was just mediocre. Bri Larson gave a well deserved Oscar winning performance, and Jacob Trembley wasn’t far behind.

This movie had a hard time choosing who to focus on, it felt awkward jumping back and fourth between the two groups throughout the second half. A fun story with writing and acting that’s nothing special. The romance between Rhodes (whose name I only remember for obvious reasons) and the French chick felt forced and out of nowhere considering they were fighting for most of the movie. The twist was also out of nowhere and quite frankly made no sense looking back. I remember liking this movie a lot more back when I watched it in sixth grade during the height of my magic hobby, but it clearly doesn’t still hold up that reputation.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-02-09

Not as good as its predecessor but still offers a lot to enjoy, the heist scene as the most noticeable case. One thing to nitpick is how farfetched they got with the magic in this one, or for example where they get the funding to pull off elaborate tricks. I'd love to see a third installment perhaps bringing back Isla Fischer as the villain for something different.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-02-10

1. I signed up to be an extra for the scenes filmed in Pittsburgh which means that the casting agency in charge took my headshot and wrote down my contact info with no audition necessary. This means that the reason why they didn't call me back either had to be that I was too attractive and they couldn’t have me distracting the viewer from Jason Mamoa, or that I had incorrectly written down my phone number and they weren’t able to contact me. 

2. Either way, my celebrity crush Isabella Merced also stars in this movie, which means that all I had to do to meet her was receive a phone call.

I will do another review once I have actually seen the movie, but I can’t imagine it being a very high score considering the circumstances.

The charm and humor is all intact, something some stories lose when transition from paper to the big (or small in this instance) screen. One of the better book adaptations I’ve seen in a while.

Speaking of casting though, I feel like Sadie Sink was the obvious choice for Kim but apparently they'd rather another redhead named Sadie?? You were this close but okay.

6th grade me would've loved this movie. An actor from the office becomes his own superhero who partakes in a gorey action-comedy that includes sexual undertones and a pair of tits. 11th grade me, however, thought it was pretty okay. The characters, for the most part, seemed a bit thin, with the exclusion of a couple very well written lines. The ending of this one was beautiful, almost bringing a tear to my eyes with the drawings and his ""perfect moments"". Eliot Page annoyed the crap out of me in Juno but I absolutely loved him in this. Rainn Wilson was also great to see, he's not too bad of an actor. Everyone else I could give or take, but it was cool to see Sean Gunn and Michael Rooker. I haven't watched any James Gunn outside of GOTG, so I was pleased to see him hold up for the most part. If I were to nitpick something, I'd have to mention the blatant bashing against Christianity, even though some of the jokes they made were admittedly pretty funny. I'd also have to take note of the odd choice to randomly add hand-drawn animation every now and then. It would've made more sense (and much cooler) if they used it to the extent of say Scott Pilgrim, but when they use it scarcely like this, it feels out of place. Sorry fellas, this was a long one, but I felt like there a lot I wanted to say.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-03-09

There are a few far-fetched or rather outlandish bits littered throughout this movie, but that's the reason I didn't rate it any higher.

Anything good this movie started out with came crumbling down in the second and third acts.

Some of the best parts of the prior movies weren't even utilized in this one, leaving me unsatisfied as a viewer. It's unfortunate this is what the franchise is left to end with, considering the prior three installments weren't half bad.

This is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story was messy, the writing was extremely weak, the performances were that of a middle school play, and the action was directed terribly so even the kinda cool fight scenes left a poor taste in my mouth. I am rarely critical of movies, I'm a sucker for good action and fun fight sequences, but this one is just so bad I can't even appreciate what minuscule details there were to appreciate. Don't watch this movie. It really, really sucks.

The acting is also nothing to brush off as I hadn't seen any of these actors before and was pleasantly surprised to see decent performances from all of them. The story was intriguing but went on a little longer than I feel it should have. I was ready to whip out a 4-star rating up until the mildly unsatisfying ending. My only hope for this movie is that they don't try to make a sequel, I feel this one is better as a stand-alone feature.

I love Impractical Jokers. I didn't love this. I liked the direction they were going for this, it's not a bad story. It's just with the lackluster acting the guys bring (which really isn't their faults, they're not actors) and the absence of some good challenges, this just isn't the best movie. I feel like if they were to add like 10 or 20 more minutes of good challenges, and gave them all some build-up, we'd have something that wasn't half bad. There were a few moments in this that I feel like came out of nowhere. For example, Murr riding on the top of a bi-plane. Hilarious. But they didn't build up to it, they just kind of threw it onto the end and it felt half-assed. I dunno with this one, I know Q pretty much directly told us to all rate it 3 and 1/2, but it just doesn't deserve it. Sorry guys, it looks like you're all tonight's biggest loser.

This, in my opinion, is the best version of Iron Man we've gotten. The dialogue is written near perfectly, and the House Party Protocol is one of my favorite scenes of the MCU. I loved the Mandarin twist, and Ultrich Killian is a great villain. Happy ended up being one of my favorite parts of the movie, but unfortunately, I feel like this is the last role in the MCU Goop actually cared about.

This movie is essentially a sing-along for me at this point, the music has become a staple of my personality and I've watched it more than any other movie, pretty much ever. It's unfortunate that this is one of the movies I didn't enjoy as much as I used to during my MCU rewatch, but it's still pretty good. I was in some dark times when I first watched this one, I had recently left my friend group and found myself crying myself to sleep most nights. I had no friends, I felt distant from my family, my grades had slumped, and I just wasn't myself. I like to think this movie was the turning point for me, hearing the music and being able to laugh really just woke me up. I started listening to more of the ""oldies"" this movie provided me with, and I had the soundtrack memorized in a week. While many of those dark feelings still linger with me today, I was able to find myself again, doing things that I enjoyed, not things that I thought I was supposed to enjoy. (Not to mention the 15-hour playlist of music from the 60s - 90s I now know every word to.) I feel like this review is only important to me, but thanks for sticking around anyway.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",2020-04-13

Not as great/iconic as the first one but still pretty darn good. James Gunn has done a great job of adding color to the MCU, and I respect him for it. Ego is a much better villain than Ronan in my opinion, and mantis is a great addition to the Guardians. I'm glad Yondu is actually dead, it adds a lot of meaning to this movie and thankfully doesn't fall into the ""nobody is actually dead"" cliche. Oh, and the scene where Yondu arrows his way out of the Ravenger ship to ""Come a Little Bit Closer"" by Jay and the Americans (one of my favorite songs), as well as his funeral scene, are two of my favorite scenes this franchise has got to offer. Well done James, well done marvel.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",2020-04-14

Haha yes! I loved this movie so much more on this time around. I'm a huge fan of Edgar Wright and being able to see his writing and a lot of his directorial and editing techniques really just made this better for me. It sucks he didn't get the final gig, I feel like AMATW suffers a bit from his absence, plus I can't imagine how much better this one would've been with his involvement. ""Those three weasels"" are probably my favorite parts of the movie, Luis especially. Darron Cross is a much better villain than I remembered, and quite honestly, everyone did a great job for the most part. Plus, who can forget possibly the greatest MCU soundtrack that I will most definitely have stuck in my head for the next few days. Overall, a great addition to the MCU.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",2020-04-14

This was the first MCU movie I ever watched in theatres when I was thirteen, and I absolutely loved it. Being able to tell my friends that I saw a PG-13 movie in theatres was, for some reason, so cool to me. I had only seen the 3 Iron Mans, The First Avenger, and The Avengers before seeing it, but I didn't care. This was my all-time favorite movie for a couple of months before I saw Jurassic World, then Civil War when I saw it and so on and so forth. The point is, I used to love movies based on the action and thrill they gave me when I watched them, a trait I diminished a little over a year ago when I really started to get into movies. I now know what good cinema is like (for me at least), so I'm able to rewatch these movies appreciate more than just the action and thrill that I loved so much in my earlier years. Which is why I still really like this movie. There's a lot of beats in there I can appreciate with my ""new eyes for cinema"", while still being able to enjoy the thrill and action my thirteen-year-old self used to gawk over. The after-party scene, quicksilver's death scene, and the conflicts between the avengers, and Ultron as a whole are all examples of said beats. In summary, this movie still holds up, much unlike the other MCU movies I've unfortunately found myself liking less and less with each rewatch. Well done Whedon, you've done it again.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",2020-04-16

A super solid first act, I love pretty much everything they did, and if the whole film was like that, it'd be a solid 4-star movie. However, as soon as Klaue died (a plot point I do NOT like), it was pretty much downhill from there. All the jokes and fun parts are pretty much exclusive to the first act. Which it's not that the tone that changes, it's more of the style that the plot goes. I really enjoyed Klaue, Ross, Killmonger, and Shuri in this one. Klaue and Killmonger made great villains, its a shame they killed both of them off. Shuri was a great addition to the cast and was responsible for a lot of the fun parts I enjoyed about the first act so much. Black Panther was a weak point for me, I feel like the performance wasn't really there from Boseman, which leads me to some of the things I didn't like. Technology in marvel movies has become a bit of a writing crutch I've noticed, meaning, for example, Ant-Man and the Wasp/ Endgame's Pym Particles and this movie's Vibranium. Considering there's no real-world equivalent to Vibranium, my opinion can be easily written off as irrelevant, however, just hear me out. I just really didn't like how the movie relied on Vibranium to easily solve its problems, i.e. a writing crutch. Imagine the final fight scene where instead of Black Panther using his annoyingly convenient kinetic energy suit to instantly blow all the bad guys into the air, he fights through the crowd in a Kingsman church scene kind of fashion. By not relying on this convenient power to instantly take everyone out, we can truly see how powerful Black Panther really is, as well as allow Coogler to show off some of his directing skills he only briefly demonstrated in this film. Those are pretty much all my thoughts on this one, which sorry because this is probably the most in-depth/longest review I've ever written. Whoops.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",2020-04-22

The writing is great, the story is like no other, and the acting is surprisingly good. I often think about what movies will stick out from our generation, like how Star Wars or Indiana Jones stick out from the '70s and '80s.

This is a great sequel. I think it did a much better job of maintaining the charm of the first one than Part II did but feels a little overcrowded with callbacks and such. Too bad I didn't watch this when I was younger. If 17 y.o. me liked that flying train at the end, I can't imagine what train obsessed 4 y.o. me woulda thought. If I were to make one minor change, however, I would've finished off that final action scene with the boiler tank actually exploding, forcing them to use the speed of them falling off the cliff as the final boost to get them to 88. I really enjoyed this re-watch, Back to the Future is definitely one of the better trilogies out there, up with the likes of Star Wars and Indiana Jones. My ranking for the trilogy (along with all of Zemeckis' other movies) are here:

This was.... a spectacular waste of time. This movie doesn't really know what it is, an awesome action flick, or an emotional drama (neither of which were accomplished). The stunt work was surprisingly well done and the action scenes were well choreographed for the most part. The selling point of this movie, at least what I saw it marketed for, was the epic one shot they had in the middle of the second act. It turned out fine, you can tell a lot of work went into it, but the cuts are painfully obvious. Hemsworth was fine, it was nice to see him as a character who's main personality trait isn't that he's handsome. Harbour was cool to see in something other than ST, and he's not that bad of an actor. His roll in this is useless but that's beside the fact. It's a little odd that the climax of the past two Russo Brother produced movies involve shutting of a city through its bridges, but I'll let it slide I guess. Also, for a fun drinking game, take a shot every time they say ""extraction"". You'll be hammered by the end of the first act.

Keanu gave a mediocre performance, with much of the cast not far behind. The movie dragged on a bit with a convoluted plotline, which made for a bit of a boring watch. I've had this on my watchlist for a while, I'm upset I didn't enjoy it more.","w/dad, @ home, prime",2020-05-18

This movie sucks. Everything with Poopy Face Mortez or whatever her name is nearly unwatchable. Half of the jokes in this movie were ""Ha ha! Little girl say swear word! She shouldn't be saying swear word!"" and it came off as very cringy and repetitive. Jim Carrey was the best part of this movie, but that's really not saying much. There's so much more I could complain about but I'm not going to because this piece of trash does not deserve any more of my time.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-05-21

Scooby-Doo was a HUGE part of my childhood. Every day after elementary my brother and  I would run home and rewatch the same 16 episodes of the original series on Boomerang. Once we had our fair share of that era, we watched What's New Scooby-Doo by forcing our grandma to buy us the DVDs anytime we went grocery shopping. After that, we watched Mystery Inc (a phenomenal show, btw). We soaked up every piece of Scooby-Doo media we could until we both kinda grew out of it. I haven't paid much attention to what they have been doing with the franchise nowadays, the animation on that new cartoon network show looked a little whack so I avoided it. It wasn't until this movie that I had reemerged myself into the world of Scooby-Doo. I was hoping it'd bring back those fond memories of bonding with my brother watching the old shows. In case you couldn't have been able to tell by my rating, it did not. It had a few easter eggs and throwbacks to the old shows (I LOVED the theme song) but besides that, there wasn't much. I think that mostly is the fault of the overstuffed plot. It was a neat idea to bring in other Hannah-Barbara characters as a way to appeal to the children more and bank of the superhero genre, but it came off forced. The whole point of the Scooby Gang is to solve mysteries and uncover which deranged janitor is taking over the amusement park this time, not work alongside superheroes. There was no mystery to this movie besides that needless five-minute intro at the beginning, this was essentially a superhero movie. Even if you put that aside, there still isn't a whole lot to like. The story feels messy, there are so many cliches (why does every movie with a ferris wheel have it fall off its bearings and roll around?!?), and its all just a tad silly. If I were to name one thing I did like, however, was some of the adult humor they threw in there, as it was the only thing in this movie that gave me a laugh. (Does DynoMutt watch porn?!) But yeah. I don't like Scoob! a whole lot.

This movie is an experience. It has some of the best cinematography, best use of colors, and best action scenes I’ve seen in any movie, probably ever. I’d love to see the script for this movie, there isn’t a ton of dialogue but I wonder what kind of choreography went into the chase scenes.

I get shivers every time I watch this movie. The music, the direction, the colors, the writing. Just wow. I was surprised by how much I related to Andrew this watch around. I tried to focus a lot on the dialogue and I found some surprising similarities. The struggle to impress his family, his troubles with romance, his relationship with his dad, etc. are all things I found in common. I played in the band in middle school (trombone), and man does my old teacher Mr. Taylor remind me of Fletcher. Not the swearing as much (keep in mind I was 14), but the motivation and constant absence of satisfaction he got from his students. He retired the year after I left, and last I saw him was at Aldi's getting beans. I wonder what happened to that guy. Anyway, yeah, it's a great movie.

My dad really wanted to show me this movie - it was one of his favorites growing up and was upset when he found we shared the same opinions.

Wow.

I don't think I've ever felt this much emotion while watching a movie before. The fear, the shock, the sadness... it's all just so accurate. I'm not trying to write an autobiography here, but back in August, my house caught on fire while my brother and I were still in it. The scariest moment of my life was when I ran out the front door, looked up at my house, and the shock sunk in that the place I had lived for the past 16 years had been destroyed. That same rush of emotions came to Sully when he realized that he was going to have to land the airplane in the river, and due to Tom Hank's performance, I had it too.

There's more to this movie that I liked however, I think non-linear storytelling was an excellent way to weave in and out of different peoples perspectives and really understand just how much these affected people. Aaron Eckhart was the perfect balance to Sully, he brought the mood back up when it was way down, and it was done perfectly. 

I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again. I really enjoyed it, but I think much like other movies, the experience will dwindle upon rewatch.

What the actual heck.

I'd ask RDJ why he signed this movie but apparently he got paid $20 million (which is 11 percent of the unreasonably large $175 million budget) so I don't blame him.

I waited about 2 days before leaving a review on this one, there was a lot to mull over and I wasn't sure what my rating was just yet. So, after some thought, I think I've come to a conclusion. The Silence of the Lambs is a great movie with an even better watching experience. It starts out with a creepy, yet safe mood in the first two acts, only to get your heart beating (much unlike Hannibal while eating that dudes tongue), when you reach the final 45 minutes.

The last time I watched this movie, I was in third grade and I somehow found the entire movie for free on youtube. When my dad came home from work and checked my search history, he was mad that I had watched a PG-13 movie without asking and took the iPod that I watched it on for 3 months. None of that affected this viewing of Spider-Man 2, but I thought it would be a worthy inclusion to my review. 

As for the movie, I thought it wasn't half bad. It's the best of the trilogy, but not by much. Doc Ock is a great villain and obviously the subway scene is the best part of the movie, maybe even the whole trilogy. I won't bother with the third one, I watched it a little while back when they had it on Netflix so I won't bother with it.

I remember watching every single promotional video they made for this movie over and over again trying to satisfy the amount of hype I had for this movie in the months leading up to its release. Once it finally came out, I invited some friends to go see it for my birthday, and I friggin loved it. I was so happy to see that now, some 6 years later, I still love this movie. The jokes still hold up and every single stickin' line is quotable. While I may not be able to recite the entire movie like I once was able to (I watched this movie at least once a week when I was younger), I still had a blast treating it like a sing-a-long of sorts acting out and saying the lines to myself as they appeared on the screen.

At surface level, My Spy is a funny, entertaining, and well-acted movie. However, as soon as you start to think about the details and what's exactly going on, it crumbles apart faster than a Nature's Valley granola bar. What My Spy really is, is a pervert-y awkward comedy that has far too many potholes and seems to appeal to a very niche audience. Thankfully, the majority of those problems disappear after the first act, and while more problems (this time more focused on the plot) arise, the movie as a whole levels out and ends up being not too shabby. Points are given to the surprisingly great performances by Chloe Colemen and Dave Bautista, the Iron Man 2/Mission Impossible/Shrek/Indiana Jones references, and the few jokes that admittedly did make me laugh.

An extremely solid first act with a second and third not far behind. Jodie Foster got annoying at times but I was willing to let that go due to literally everyone else in this movie bringing their A-game. I've only seen Leto in Suicide Squad and was excited to see he's not all that bad of an actor. David Fincher was a delight as always, especially with some of the awesome VFX shots he added into the mix to make the cinematography just that much better. Super suspenseful, pretty great.

Performances were fine for the most part but boy do I love JK Simmons. I keep bouncing back and forth between 3 or 3 1/2 stars for this one; I've settled on 3 for now but I'm sure that's subject to change as I think about it more.

As for the special, it wasn't half bad. It was nice to see all of the cast giving their ""origin stories"" for the show and all that, but for this review and rating, I'm going to be referring to the show as a whole. I marathoned the first 10 seasons of Modern Family last summer but never ended up watching season 11 while it was airing, so I watched it over the last 3 days. Modern Family was a pretty consistent show, it had its ups and downs but it didn’t get worse as it went on and escaped any fatigue that most shows face as they hit the later seasons. Humor was definitely this show's strong suit. Pretty much every episode made laugh at least once, which is something most tv shows struggle to do. But yeah, Modern Family sprinted through the finish and probably could've gone for another couple seasons and I'm sad to see it go.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",

With Psych being one of my favorite TV shows, I went into this one with very high expectations. Psych is a TV show consisting of great humor, suspenseful mystery, and a comforting cast of characters that you can always unwind with after a long day. However, Psych 2: Lassie Come Home unfortunately just didn't quite do it for me. The cast didn't really play their roles well, the writing was a jumbled mess of callbacks, and it overall just came off like a messy cash grab and cheap way to get some sort of fanbase onto Peacock. I hope they make a 3rd one eventually, I'm not quite done with these characters yet and I hope they learn from their mistakes after making this one.

Clueless is funny, entertaining, and the definition of a cult classic. I wasn't sure what to write for this review, so here's a list of thoughts I had while watching it.

- No one has ever looked better in a movie than Alicia Silverstone in this
- Cher and Tai are some of the most attractive movie characters ever
- Cher will say ""retard"" but not ""virginity"" because ""virginity"" isn't CP
- This movie invented the most popular porn genre 
- To see what happens immediately after this movie, just watch any PH video with ""step-sister"" in the title
- Travis gives off the best vibe ever
- Every time Mr. Wendell spoke all I could think of was Rex from Toy Story screaming and the teacher from The Incredibles yelling ""Right there! Right as I sit down! He's guilty I tell you! Guilty!""
- Paul Rudd really hasn't aged a day
- This movie is more 90s than the 90s themselves
- I wish dance clubs were still open like that because that looks FUN
- I finished this 10 minutes ago and I already want to rewatch it","w/ myself, @ home, netflix",2020-07-22

I wrote jokes for reviews for the two prior installments of the trilogy, so I'm going to write the trilogy a review for this one.

First off, they really aren't all that bad. The writing and acting are both pretty good, which quite a surprise. They nailed the Brother-brother and father-son relationships, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could relate to some of the stuff that was going on. I was a huge fan of the books as a kid, I remember begging my Mom to give me money to buy the newest one at the Scholastic Book Fair, so these movies carry a bit of nostalgia for me. It's a shame they stopped it after only 3 movies, I wouldn't have minded seeing them continue through the rest of the book series, especially after seeing how terrible the 2017 one turned out.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",2020-07-26

I'm gonna be honest, I couldn't finish this movie. I got about halfway through before I couldn't take it anymore and just shut it off. The performances were fine but the direction, editing, vfx, and music choice all sucked. You mean to tell me people listened to Will.i.am in the 1920s? Blah!

An absurdly political ""action"" movie that throws the most interesting part of its plot out the door after only 10 minutes. Performances were weak, the tone shifted every minute, and finished as what seemed like a rough draft of what could've been a mediocre movie. The cinematography was reminiscent of Leigh Whannel, which was a nice surprise and thankfully made the movie a little easier to watch. I think if the plot were fleshed and smoothed out a little more, a couple of recasts were made, and a proper, defined tone was put in place and kept throughout the movie, this thing wouldn't have been half bad. I wouldn't mind a sequel if these changes were made, I think there's some good potential for a fun movie if they don't take themselves too seriously.

A wholesome yet frustrating story that drags on way too long. I think if they cut the crap and polished this off in about an hour and 45 minutes, it’d be much more enjoyable. I was surprised to hear Jack Nicholson won best actor for this role (hot take incoming), as his performance felt messy and inconsistent. I had the same thoughts about his performance in The Shinning, so maybe I’m just misunderstanding what makes him so great.

Excited to see what other surprises Jordan Peele has up his sleeve when it comes to the future of his film making career. As for the cast, everyone was great. The switches back and forth between being absurdly creepy and accurately depicting those weird relatives everyone has (as if those two aren't the same things) were perfect and probably couldn't have been any better. I don't have much else to say, this movie is great and is highly recommendable.

Considering Die Hard was the very first movie I put on my watchlist when I joined this website, it feels very good to finally say I've watched it. Usually when I watch older action movies that are seen at classics, I'm ultimately underwhelmed. The action comes off too far-fetched, the dialogue is cheesy, and the action comes off as dull and unentertaining when compared to the modern-day version of the genre (i.e. <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/rejilliken/film/speed/"" rel=""nofollow"">Speed).</a>

Thankfully with Die Hard, this was not the case. I've got nothing but good things to say about this 80s classic, so instead of wasting my time saying things that have already been said millions of times in other reviews, I'm going to share what I couldn't stop thinking about the entire movie, which is who I'd cast if this movie was made today.

I seriously don't understand why Brad Bird doesn't just write/direct every movie coming out of Hollywood. There is so freakin much I enjoy about this movie. The writing is seriously some of the best writing I've seen, the action is suspenseful and well-directed, and the animation is absolutely impeccable. Bird absolutely nailed writing the family dynamic of this movie, the constant bickering and a lot of Bob's lines are spot-on and totally relatable. I was surprised to see I enjoyed this one better than the first during this rewatch, and while Syndrome may still be the better villain, Incredibles 2 takes the cake for the overall better movie. It seems like any and every movie that makes more than 50 cents at the box office gets a sequel, so I really hope that trend continues for this one and Brad Bird gets to write an even better Incredibles 3.

This is my first rewatch for Parasite of 2020 and I won't lie, it wasn't as good as I remember. Suspense is a HUGE part of this movie, so having already seen it and already knowing what's going to happen unfortunately really dampened that experience. However, being able to pick out the foreshadowing revealed during the rewatch helped even out that disappointment. II was able to really appreciate the cinematography and direction on my second go-around too; I could pay less attention to reading and spend more time watching the camera work since I already know the story. So, in conclusion, Parasite is a great movie with a lot of great aspects, but in my humble opinion, it doesn't quite deserve that #1 spot.

A tad mundane and I don't really like the overall tone of this one. One of the things I like about this trilogy is that each film kinda has its own tone, however for this one I just wasn't a huge fan. Ras Al Gul isn't that special of a villain in my opinion, with Scarecrow, not any better apart from the visuals.

My favorite of the Nolan Trilogy but still wasn't as good as I remember it being.

The Dark Knight Rises is definitely the most fun to watch out of the trilogy, but is also, unfortunately, the thinnest written and has the most plot holes. Looking back on the trilogy, I quite liked how Nolan tackled batman's villains. He was able to include their defining features without their far-fetched backstories that may not have translated onto the screen very well with this iteration of Batman (i.e. Ra's Al Ghul's immortality without the Lazarus Pit, Joker without the vat of acid, and Bane without the super steroids). I thought a nice touch that Nolan used was cutting to a full-screen aspect ratio when showing off the practical effects. There was a lot of great work done and it definitely helped bring more attention to it and allowed me to enjoy it more.

My dad and I are usually pretty good at figuring out how a movie is to end, so this was definitely very refreshing. We were able to figure out a few details here or there but when that big reveal came around we were shocked. 

Leo and Mark were both great and definitely made the movie what it is. 

I'm not sure how to describe it, but I have a feeling of dissatisfaction after finishing this. Perhaps a rewatch might be soon to come to resolve this problem. 

I usually don't like Scorsese but I didn't mind this (and before any of you say I haven't watched anything, I've started a few of his movies but I haven't been able to get through them so I don't mark them as watched), so I might retry a few of his older flicks sometime soon.

I think the reason why I have such a strong connection to the coming of age genre is because they're the kind of movies I want to create when I'm older; a meaningful story with some great comedy and just enough emotion to make you well up. That is the perfect description of this movie and is probably most of the reasons why I enjoy it

Also, I recommended this movie to my very religious cousin as a joke a couple of weeks ago because it was her seventeenth birthday but she took it seriously and watched it with her parents, and now I will no longer be attending family events.

As for the movie itself, I don't really have much to comment on. Woody Harrelson was a delight and the writing wasn't half bad. Not as good my second time around but still not half bad.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-08-28

Enjoyed this one a lot better second time around. I think the standout feature is its comedy; this movie is really funny. I always have a problem with how coming of age stories depict high school because they're almost never accurate. However, I'm willing to let this one slide because they absolutely nailed every other aspect of it (the stereotypes, the relationships, etc.). The cast was all great, but I mean I don't know how a cast including Will Forte and Jason Sudekis couldn't be. Booksmart is one of the best I've seen of the coming of age genre, which makes me really curious as to what Olivia Wilde has in store next for her directing career.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-08-30

As a kid who grew up with Phineas and Ferb, this movie held a lot of nostalgia for me. However, that unfortunately did not exempt this movie from a poor rating. The writing was poor, the story hit every cliche in the book, and I found myself checking how much time was left every 5 minutes or so. On the bright side, the humor was great. I found my self genuinely laughing multiple times throughout the movie, which was a pleasant surprise for sure. All in all, I'm glad this movie was made. Phineas and Ferb was a staple of my childhood and with Disney continuing to put out new P&F content, it gets to be a staple of the childhoods of the next generation too.

I don't know what I just watched (or whether I even finished/started it yet) but I don't think I enjoyed it. My thoughts and rating are subject to change as I continue to mull it all over for the rest of the day, so don't get too attached to any opinions I've stated here. First off, this movie is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It defies everything I've ever known about film and I think that was the reason I didn't turn it off. The runtime and mostly dull scenes really made it hard to get through. On top of that, there wasn't really any story to follow or get invested in, its just a cluster of random thoughts and emotion construed into an absurdly long run time. It's so hard to put into words what I think about this movie so that's all I've got for today.

From what I can tell, Tenet’s ambiguity is to audiences as the porridge was to Goldilocks; it’s either too much, not enough, or just right.  For me, it was just right. I was able to understand the plot while still being able to figure out a few things for myself, which is generally just the way I like it. The writing was on the weaker side (for Nolan’s standards), but the action was some of his best. Every action scene was expertly executed both in concept and direction, and I gotta say, it made for a pretty fun watch. Being able to “rewatch” the scenes from different perspectives was a really neat idea and really added a nice level of depth to the story (imagine directing that!!). However, this did make the movie a little predictable by the end of it all, but that third act had so much going on it didn’t end up bothering me a whole lot. I definitely gotta watch this again, I’m interested to see if I end up liking it more or less upon rewatch. Overall, it was a fun watch and it felt good to be back in theaters again.

Bill & Ted Face the Music was fine as a movie but mediocre as a sequel. I think if they keep to the 80's retro vibe that the first two excellently executed, this one would've been a lot better. The first two had great practical effects; if they kept those around and got rid of that terrible CGI, I think that would've largely fixed the vibe. From a story standpoint, this movie was written very well. It was a great follow up to the first two while still keeping it new and interesting. Another small complaint I had was the movie's countdown. They kept referencing how many minutes they had left but it didn't match up with the end of the movie or the other references. I guess that can be blamed on the editing, which would make sense because that wasn't too hot either. All of the performances were fine, I think the daughters where a little weak but having to copy their father's performances was no easy task. So, in conclusion, while not as good as the first two, Bill and Ted Face The Music was a worthy sequel and was a great time to watch.

I'm really conflicted about my rating for this one. On one hand, it's really not that bad of a flick. On the other hand, it's written in a way that makes you sympathize with Dahmer, which isn't exactly my preferred feeling towards a guy who ate people. I've only seen Lynch in Austin and Ally and Teen Beach Movie, so it's hard to say whether I thought his performance was good or just different from what I'm used to seeing. The rest of the performances were pretty crap, it almost seemed like their characters were SNL parodies of the characters that should actually be in this movie. I don't know, this is kind of a weird one, and like I said I can't really compile my thoughts for it. I'll probably revisit this review once I've thought about it a little more and make some changes.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-09-15

There are some significant plot holes here or there, but besides that, it's a hell of a lot of fun (that church scene is one of my top 10 favorite movie scenes for sure). Matthew Vaughn's style of directing has made him one of my favorite directors, his way of doing action scenes is so unique and fun it really makes his movies stick out.

Spree is a thinly written, visually unique social commentary thriller that left me unsure as to what I thought of it. The editing style is something I've never seen before, and it really made the watching experience that more interesting. The performances were nothing special, but that's most likely the fault of the casting director who chose some really odd choices. There were people in this movie from all over the place; from a random NHL player to Jared, who I guess can finally fucking learn how to read. Overall, this movie made for a good time. The kills were fun, there were a couple of good laughs, and it was entertaining just watching Joe Keery be really weird.

Prisoners is a GREAT movie. The performances are crazy good, the direction is stellar (those shots of Dano in the shower🤤🤤), and it all really makes for a great watch. However, it doesn't go without its faults. I think the B plot with David Dastmalchain's character, while very intriguing, takes away from the main story. It links in here or there but I honestly think the movie could have done without it. I first watched this back in December, so I forgot most of the plot lines and was able to enjoy some of those twists again, which obviously made for a great time. Overall, Prisoners is an essential watch for anyone who enjoys suspense or just wants to watch Jake Gyllenhaal blink and hold a gun weird. Also, how did Villinueve direct both this and Enemy in the same year?!

I waited a couple of days before reviewing this; I felt like I needed to let it sink in a bit as there was a lot to mull over. First off, I think this is the movie that 2020 needs right now. At the time of writing this, America is in the midst of a race war, something that this movie tackles very well. This movie was a few things for me, but it was primarily eye-opening. A lot of the topics and themes that were addressed in this movie were things that I've never experienced or really even thought of as something that could be experienced. Right off the bat, in the very first scene, Starr's Dad gives Starr and her brother ""the talk"". For me, ""the talk"" was when my Dad sat me down and discussed my changing body and how these next couple of years might pose a lot of questions. However, for Starr and her brother, ""the talk"" was about what to do when you got pulled over. Starr's Dad discussed how you should keep your hands in view of the officer and to listen to everything that they say. This conversation hit me like a ton of bricks; I had never even heard of this kind of talk before let alone received it. Another scene that really hit me was Khalil's death. Obviously, in the past couple of months, a lot of the same things that happened to Khalil have been happening in the real world too. And while I was affected by these real-world cases, Khalil's really got to me. Being able to be in the moment with him and experience first-person how unjustified his killing was really allowed me to understand how horrible these things that have been happening are. I am very prone to displaying my emotions while watching a movie; I'll laugh, smile, and cry but I'll never get angry. But, watching Khalil get shot for doing nothing but trying to comb his hair really hit me hard. As I said, this movie was very eye-opening to me, and I can see it having the same effect on a lot of others too. The Hate U Give is a must-watch for everyone right now, so please check it out if you haven't already.","w/ myself, @ home, film studies, journal entry, sparrow",2020-09-24

Funny, charming, well-acted, and wholesome, but lost its touch in the third act. Could have gone without the flash-forward at the end, and a sequel that explored his teenage years could’ve been really interesting.

Me: You know what? I've been watching a lot of trash films lately. I need a good, well-rated movie to polish off the weekend. Perhaps No Country of Old Men? I've been meaning to watch it, and the TV is open for me to enjoy it on the flat screen. I'll grab a soda, pop some popcorn and really just enjoy myself.

Also me: Nah fam we watching big metal dudes beat the shit out of each other yee haw😎😎😈😈

Ok, but for real, can we talk about how stupid this movie gets at times? They killed off the boy's mom but he doesn't seem affected by it like I feel like he'd at least be a little broken up about it right? What was the point of Evangeline Lily's character? All she did was drink beer, shout, and cry. Which, speaking of crying, why were they all crying at the end? It wasn't a touching moment at all and came off really stupid. Why was Atom more resilient than other bots? They don't have personalities or perseverance or anything so what made him so special? I get that this is some futuristic reality but how the heck does the shadowing work? Even if the pilot doesn't need to wear sensors or anything I feel like the bot at least has to see him right? I feel like a common issue among movies that take place in the future is they use the fact that they're in the future as a solution to all their plot holes and it ends up coming off lazy. Nevertheless, this movie is a fun watch and comes off as super nostalgic to me.

Too much inconsistency with multiple aspects of the film. The fourth wall is broken multiple times in the first 5 minutes but then is never revisited again throughout the remainder of the movie. Furthermore, the lower thirds for new characters being introduced changed every time one appears. It's worth noting that it didn't dampen the movie at all, it just was odd and I felt like it was worth bringing up. Another issue I had was the constant use of handheld shots. I know it's a bit nitpicky, but it almost felt as if they were just being lazy and didn't feel like setting up a tripod. A fine movie, but not deserving of any academy awards, in my opinion. Oh, and one last thing, I feel like a movie on woman empowerment is a great reason to have a woman director, therefore choosing the guy responsible for the Austin Power franchise (no hate, all groovy baby!) seems a bit off.","w/ myself, @ home, journal entry, sparrow",2020-09-29

This is another one of those movies that is neither good nor bad; everything just kinda cancels itself out. The action scenes are fun, but the writing is thin. The Cgi is mediocre, the performances are mediocre. See? It's all just... eh. I do find it funny that Alec Utgof's character in this movie was the same as his character's name in Stranger Things.

Geez, this movie can be so offensive that I feel like a more appropriate movie could be made out of the book ""Racial Slurs for Dummies"".

However, if you can learn to cover your ears every time Clint Eastwood appears on the screen, it's really quite an enjoyable movie. It's fun to watch the parallels that unfold as the story progresses. 

For example, Thao goes from stealing the car to inheriting it, Walt goes from attending a funeral to being in his own, and most significantly, Walt also goes from hating every person on his street to ultimately dying for them in the end. And while sure, this cliche has been tackled many times before, I feel like it was pulled off here the best. 

Walt at the beginning of the movie compared to Walt at the end of the movie is like night and day (both physically and figuratively), which is probably the most extreme case of character development I've ever seen. 

I think if I had to say anything negative about this movie, I'd comment on the performances. It's not like anyone was so bad that it made the movie hard to watch, but it did take me out of the movie here or there.

In conclusion, I did quite enjoy this flick. This is the second time (the first being Sully (2016)) Eastwood has impressed me with his direction so I'm sure it won't be his last either. I'll have to check out more of his stuff in the future.

Oh, and just as a side note, I did watch this movie in 40-minute increments across 3 weeks in my film studies class, so the beginning parts of the movie aren't as fresh in my head as the end parts, which could dampen my rating and overall viewing experience. It's a little annoying but it's something I'll just deal with because I've got a whole semester of this type of viewing.","film studies, journal entry, @ school, sparrow",2020-09-29

First off, I had to read the book for my tenth grade English class, so a lot of it was still fresh in my mind and I wasn't able to get that surprise factor that some parts are supposed to have it. Despite those circumstances, I did still really enjoy this. I feel like you have to be really skilled in the art of filmmaking to keep someone entertained with just dialogue and the interior of a conference room, so big credit to Sidney Lumet. I think one of my favorite parts about this movie is the little character moments that are sprinkled throughout the movie. Each of the jurors gets a scene where they not only get to show off their acting skills but also make their character unique. I feel like you need a really good cast to be able to have the audience tell apart 12 black and white men with the same haircut. I think I'll wait a while before watching this again, I fear I might get a little bored rewatching so soon, so I want to wait a while and hopefully, I'll forget some of the plot points.","w/ myself, @ home, journal entry, sparrow",2020-09-30

This movie feels like if Tim Burton took one of my old essays, added another paragraph of exposition, changed the font to comic sans, and then turned it in as his own. It's different from the original, but only by adding more detail and some updated, yet unfavorable, special effects. Doing a remake of the original without facing these problems would admittedly be pretty difficult, so in my opinion, this movie shouldn't even have been made at all. Johnny Depp's performance is fine, it's just really hard to compare it to Gene Wilder's because they're so different. I definitely like Wilder's more, but that doesn't mean that I think Depp's is bad, it's just... odd. I watched this back to back with the original, which definitely didn't do this one any favors. The first is way better in pretty much every aspect, so in my headcanon, this one just doesn't exist.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-09-30

Well made but boy was that boring. I think the main thing to fault here is the pacing. For some reason, this movie flies through the interesting parts but slows down and drudges through the dull parts. One thing this movie was great at was performances. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones both did a great job, definitely the best from what I've seen from either of them. With Jones, you could really tell how she was struggling through her relationship with Hawking and how she was tempted by Cox, and with Redmayne, he just really did a good job portraying hawking, a character I assume is pretty hard to pull off. Another thing this movie does well is the colors. Each frame has a very strong and vivid color palette and it does a great job of setting the tone for the scene when maybe the writing could do so. The ending was nice, it was a cool way of wrapping stuff up with the reverse ramped-speed montage of the whole movie, yet again showing off its stellar use of color. Overall, it's really just a mediocre movie in my opinion. It was well deserved with the awards it won when it comes to performances, but that's really the only thing worth any awards in this movie.","w/ myself, @ home, netflix, film studies, journal entry",2020-10-01

Watched with dad and bro. Bro did not like it and left after 20 minutes because it did not include sex or guns. Dad stayed the whole way through and really enjoyed it. Movies are always better when the person you're watching with enjoys it too. I bought the Cornetto Trilogy at Target for $10 so I'm excited to watch the rest of them at some later time. Hopefully, bro likes the rest and actually decides to stick around because all of them are quality movies, even though this one is admittedly the weaker of the three. For a zombie movie, it was surprisingly dull. There were some nice character moments but I feel like they took up too much time. My teenage brain needs more zombies!

The performances were obviously great, the awards don't matter yadda yadda but they both deserved at least a nom or something for the incredible work done from both parties. I want to watch Egger's other movie The VVitch but I need at least one month of recovery time before I watch anything else similar to this.

I think I should preface this by saying that Rear Window was my first Alfred Hitchcock film. Which, as far as first impressions go, this one wasn't too shabby. There were a lot of interesting choices made in the production of this movie that I'd like to draw attention to. First off, the set design is great. I loved how all the shots looked like we were peering through dollhouse windows, which was an effect that was only aided by the genius directorial choice to keep the camera's boundaries the same as Stewart's and only leaving the apartment when he does. Some smaller details I noticed were the POV shots included, with the ones looking through the camera and the ones showing the orange tint caused by the camera flashes being my favorites. I feel like the parts where it was mainly just conversation in the apartment dragged on a little bit, which I can't get too bothered by as I think that might have been Hitchcock's intention. By causing us to sit through those long scenes, we were able to get a sense of what it was like to be Stewart; unable to move and investigate for ourselves what really is going on. The final thing I'd like to address is the story, which was no disappointment. I think if I were to make one change, it'd be that the man they were stalking didn't end up killing his wife, and they all kind of just fabricated the case themselves. For example, instead of them catching him in the end there's a twist which reveals that everything that they previously saw as evidence was just misinterpreted and he didn't do anything wrong. Whether that'd be an interesting change or I'm just trying to justify how I also went crazy when I was stuck inside my house for a long amount of time during quarantine is something I'll leave up to you to decide.","w/ myself, @ home, film studies, journal entry, sparrow",2020-10-09

As I would the rest of Anderson's movies, the word I would use to describe this is ""quaint"". I think one of the more interesting parts of this movie is watching Anderson develop his style. While The Royal Tenenbaums oozes with Anderson's personality and style, when it's compared to the super-stylized The Grand Budapest Hotel, it looks like a blank sheet of cardstock. This is my no measure a bad thing, It's just an interesting point of comparison when showing how Anderson has evolved over the years. I really have nothing but the whole movie to compliment; the direction, set design, costumes, cast, song choice, writing, etc. It's just for some reason, the movie as a whole just isn't that special to me. It's worth noting that I don't mean special in the sense that it isn't unique, but in the sense that it just doesn't leave a huge impact on me or mean anything deeper than it just being a movie. It's a good watch that just doesn't check enough boxes to make it a great watch.","w/dad, @ home, prime",2020-10-15

It almost felt like a propaganda video made by the aliens to subconsciously trick us into not being afraid of them when they come. Oh, and I finally get that Monsters vs. Aliens reference now.

This is the second film Yorgos Lanthimos that I've seen and I'm starting to like his style. I was unsure of his deadpan tones at first but after some thought, I think it works quite well with the films he puts them in.

The Graduate is as good as it gets when it comes to cinematography. The constant depth of field, the layers, and of course the fish tank metaphor which was used by constantly framing Ben is separate smaller frames such as windows and door frames. The fish tank metaphor was a great way to show the emotional and mental state of Ben without having him say anything. It's essentially showing the metaphor instead of saying it, which is a really cool way of doing it. I feel like we're currently in an age of Hollywood struggling to be unique, so this was a nice refresher of how good it can really be when it comes to storytelling. I have seen plenty of rom-coms over the years but never one where the plot includes a love triangle between a mother, a daughter, and her boyfriend; it almost feels like something from an adult film. Another thing I think this film does well is its subtle comedy. It made me laugh not strictly through telling jokes but through ironic situations too. For example, multiple times throughout the movie Ben is ignored and no one will talk to him. To me, this is a better way of achieving comedy than say a one-liner or slapstick, you have to pay attention to notice it. It's almost like the film rewards you for paying attention with comedy. I think that overall, this film definitely deserves its label as a ""classic movie"". It's a unique story told through multiple genres all the while setting the standard for what great cinematography should look like.","@ school, film studies, journal entry",2020-10-22

If I were to add anything, it'd be more of those man on the street pranking type segments. There were a few bits here and there that I couldn't tell if they were staged or not, so my assessment could be a tad off. This was the longest presidential campaign advertisement I've ever seen, and I'm really interested in what Twitter will have to say about it.

I think I ruined this for myself by expecting it to be like all of Nolan's other movies; 140 minutes of jaw-dropping, non-stop action the whole way through.

I enjoyed the movie, it was much like Nolan's others in the sense that there are constant twists to keep you on your toes, but the settings and color palette just make it boring to watch. I'm sure I'll enjoy it a lot more on rewatch, but for the time being The Prestige is as mediocre as they come.

Even on my third rewatch, Parasite continued to break my expectations. Usually, when you watch a movie three times within the span of a year, you get pretty bored with it. However, Parasite yet again defied stereotypes and made my most recent rewatch just as good as the prior two. I think the main reason why Parasite continues to be interesting is with it's hidden details. Each time I watch it I notice new details and imagery that I missed the time before. For example, the extraordinary uses of foreshadowing and dramatic irony, with the quote ""I can only trust a recommendation from someone I know well"" being one of my favorites from the movie. I'm sure that the next time I watch this, I'll discover even more instances of these cinematic devices, adding to the already library's worth of ones that I've already noticed. One point I'd like to talk about is the ending, and whether Ki-Woo buys the house or not. In my opinion, Ki-Woo does not buy the house and has to resort to an entirely different way of extracting his father from the basement. The entire plot of the movie revolves around a failed plan, so I feel that it wouldn't make any sense story-wise for Ki-Woo's arguably more ambitious plan to succeed. I read an article recently about what makes a movie a ""classic"", and while the article defends the stance that a film needs to be at least 25 years old to be considered as such, I beg to differ. A ""classic"" movie, in my opinion, is a movie that has a large impact on the film community and its audience as a whole; Pulp Fiction, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Truman Show, etc. Therefore, Parasite, a movie that has had those exact effects but 100 times stronger, is more than qualified and should be considered a classic.

Beautiful cinematography. I love how different objects are constantly making the frame smaller for Simon, it was a nice touch to emphasize his insignificance to the world around him. The sound design is great, with different noises constantly morphing and switching between diegetic and non-diegetic. The dull and mundane color pallette fits this movie nicely, but it does make the scenes with too much color seem out of place. I love witty little jokes and exchanges between different characters that are found multiple times throughout this movie. It's my favorite kind of dialogue, and it's executed perfectly here. As for performances, there's nothing special. Jessie Eisenberg, much like all his other roles, just played himself. A quality flick, and a great rec from my friend Adam. Thanks, Adam!

I watched this almost two weeks ago, but I've just been sitting on it and mulling it over trying to form a concrete opinion. First off, most of my grievances with this movie are just style choices made by Tarantino. As much as I respect his style, I'm just, for the most part, not a huge fan of it. For example, the intro scene is written very well, but the direction and editing are unfavorable. I feel like a standard ""conversational piece"" style would have been a lot better; standard cuts back and forth between the characters with the occasional establishing shot here or there. However, Tarantino chooses to make each shot unique, showing a new angle of the room and the people in it each time he cuts. This kept taking me out of the movie as I was trying to focus on the writing but kept getting distracted by the edits. Another style choice I wasn't a huge fan of was the name tags that showed up for a couple of the characters. I'm usually a huge fan of this type of editing, it can add a nice flair to what could otherwise be a dull movie. However, in this case, it's done inconsistently and not every character gets one. This scarcity makes the name tags feel out of place and disorganized, which in my opinion, brings the movie down as a whole. There are a few things that I enjoy about this movie, such as the great visual/practical effects, the symbolism, and how Tarantino can entertain me with a language I don't even speak, but overall, I'm not the biggest fan of this movie.","w/ myself, @ home, film studies, journal entry, sparrow",2020-11-11

Snowden is a movie that has no idea what to focus on. Hacking? Epilepsy? Army training? Romance? And while one could argue that these are just subplots, they are presented in a very blocky and disorganized form. It's hard to tell whether the movie is nonlinear or just horribly edited as a result of this. As much of a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan I am, I borderline hated him in this. He tried way too hard and didn't end up playing the role well at all. The rest of the acting wasn't too good either, of course apart from Nick Cage (I got exactly what I expected from him). Snowden? More like No-win because this movie did not win any awards (not that it should have).","w/ myself, in car, netflix",2020-11-12

Did the virus also affect everyone’s capability to act? There was not a single decent performance in this entire movie, literally everyone sucked. The story progressed awkwardly, there were so many characters with nothing to do, no one acted like people, there was no Shyamalan twist; it all just sucked. That being said, I oddly didn’t mind it. I enjoyed pointing out all of the things that made this movie suck, so I really didn’t have a bad time watching it. Oh, and the parallels between the virus in this and COVID are laughable.


Edit: I originally had this movie at 3 stars just because I had a good time pointing out all that was horrible about this movie. After some pondering over said horrible things, I have concluded that this movie is far too bad to be rated anything above what it truly deserves.

As much as I enjoyed my theatre experience, the movie itself wasn't too hot. It's a fun movie, just not a great one. There were a couple of good bits with Vince Vaughn that actually made me laugh, mainly the little mannerisms he does while acting like a teenage girl. I thought all the acting was pretty good, Vince Vaughn was the only actor I had heard of going into this so I was pleasantly surprised when everyone else did pretty well. It was awesome to see Alan Ruck show up, as it's always fun to see him pop up in stuff. The kills were cheesy but fun, even though there weren't a ton of them. As for the bad stuff, I feel like the screenwriters just went through a checklist and made sure they had every single cliche possible. I'm tired of the same old inaccurate high school cliches that movies can't seem to ditch. Conveniences run the plot, and it should have ended at least 10 minutes before it actually did. If they plan on doing a sequel, it's going to be real messy trying to bring anyone back. There's only so much you can do with this weird little body switch subgenre of film, and when you don't bring anything new to the table, you have to question whether the movie was even worth being made at all. I'm sure I'll think of more to complain about, but that's all for now. Oh, and nothing could have prepared me for that scene in the car. I verbally reacted to that in the theatre and I can't believe it made the final cut.

I watched this in Korean with English subtitles. Netflix had the option to watch it with an overdub, but I figured the subtitles would be closer to how the director intended it to be watched. I gotta say, Korea knows how to make a good zombie movie. First Train to Busan, and now this; I'll definitely be keeping my eye out for any other movies that fall into this genre (K-Zombie??). The acting was mediocre, and I really enjoyed the story. Instead of focusing on squeezing as many kills and as much gore as they could into its runtime, they decided to focus on the more human (pun intended) side of things and do a love story. The plot develops nicely, there are a couple of good twists that make the story interesting, and my only complaint would be the end, in which I think it would have been much better to do something similar to The Mist (iykyk).

With Ocean's Eleven being such a masterpiece, it's a shame to see this one not live up to the hype. Everything was fine and dandy until the third act; my biggest problem with this movie is the whole Julia Roberts thing. Usually, I'm fine with movies doing the whole meta thing with actors playing themselves when it's done in a comedy or more light-hearted movie. However, when it's done in a movie that takes itself as seriously as this one does, it just doesn't work. The plot is much weaker than the first one, the writing is much weaker than the first one, the ending isn't as satisfying as the first one; you get my point.

I didn't pirate this, but if I had, I wouldn't feel bad about it because that's definitely the way Debbie Ocean would want this to be watched.

Ocean's Eight was honestly a solid 4-star movie up until the third act. The story just kind of fell apart and it went on 30 minutes longer than it should have. Gary Ross made an obvious attempt to copy Steven Soderberg's style, and while he did it for the most part, it felt like a cheaper, knock-off version that failed to live up to its prior installments. The casting was spot-on; I hope they finish this trilogy just out of curiosity of who else they add to the line-up. In conclusion, Ocean's Eight is a fun watch that tries its best to live up to the prior installments but falls apart in the third act.

To be honest, it isn't the shit show I expected it to be. There were some pretty cool visuals, the interpretation of the characters was pretty well done, and the performances, for the most part, weren't half bad. The story felt way too long despite it only being 94 minutes, and the whole first half was just lots of slowly told exposition. For a movie that has been delayed four times over the past two and a half years, I figured they would've come up with something a little better than this.

I really want to love this movie, but I have a lot of conflicting thoughts. I like the choppy editing in most cases, as it shows how unstable Jack is, but it gets really annoying and feels unneeded in other cases. I like the soundtrack, but it gets so repetitive and makes the movie feel stale by the end of it. As for things I'm not conflicted about, I love how brutal this movie is. It does not pull punches or compromise on anything and I admire it for that. The acting is phenomenal, and the story is constructed and executed perfectly. I haven't seen anything else from Lars Von Trier, but if this is his tamest film like I've heard, I'm not sure I'll be watching any more in the near future. I first watched this movie right when it was released, far before I really got into film. That being said, it was no surprise that I didn't like it the first time around. My favorite movie was Jurassic World and only considered movies good if they included cool action scenes and a heavy use of CGI. I wonder now how many movies I've given this same treatment to, perhaps I have a rewatch binge in my near future.

My opinion on The Polar Express is weird, I both love and hate it. The things that I like, I really like; the train action sequences, most of the animation, the direction, and the story. And the things that I don't like, I really don't like; the character animations, the usage of live-action footage, how inefficient The Polar Express' route is, the weird repeating sound bites that used to haunt me as a child, and the score. However, I have to give credit where credit is due because this movie holds a ton of nostalgia for me. I know I've talked about this before in my The Commuter review, but my Grandpa is a huge fan of trains and used to have a huge set up of model trains in his basement when I was younger. This made a huge impression on me, and I became infatuated with trains during my early years. I have since grown out of my obsession, but it has still left its impression on me. I always grin when I see a train out in the wild and I am always more susceptible to giving movies higher ratings when they have a train in them. That being said, I have given the Polar Express three and a half stars. I think I know deep down that this movie doesn't deserve that high of a rating, but I'm happy to do it purely because of the nostalgia. Oh, and two more things. It took me way to long to realize half of the characters in this movie are played by Tom Hanks, and I think it's worth noting that the first time I watched this movie when I was 5 or 6 I stayed up ""all night"" (which was probably only 9 or 10 pm) waiting for the Polar Express to come and pick me up. Spoiler alert, it never came.

2020-12-15,Shithouse,2020,https://boxd.it/1vMqSV,4,,"88/100

Shithouse, in my opinion, is the perfect romantic comedy. It's able to accomplish something that almost every other rom-com I've seen hasn't; accurately depicting love. I feel like in most movies, love is depicted as this sappy, perfect, almost unearthly thing that only characters in movies can experience. I don't feel that way about people, and I don't want to watch movies where people do. I want to watch a movie that I can relate to and find something about myself in the characters I'm watching, which is something I did multiple times across the entire cast while watching this movie. I found a part of myself in all the characters and seeing how they reacted with each other seemed so familiar to me. Shithouse is almost perfect in that sense, it depicts feelings the way they actually are. Another thing I'd like to mention is how beautiful the writing is. I could see myself having any of the conversations from the movie with a friend in real life; the writing is so natural to the point where it feels like improv. Shithouse is easily one of the best of the year, so please check it out if you haven't already. I really want to revisit this one again about a year from now when I'm 2 semesters deep into my first year of college.

If there's one thing I've learned from my rewatch, it's that I just love the aesthetic of the prequels. Revenge of the Sith is a perfect finale to this trilogy; it wraps up all the plotlines in a satisfying way while still starting new ones to be continued in the later installments. The lightsaber fights, while foolish at times, are so fun to watch and still have not grown dull despite how many times I've seen them. Oh, and extra points for being the movie (besides maybe Shrek?) with the most effect on the meme economy.

The layout and progression of the final fight in space are just so genius and incredibly entertaining to watch. Each time I watch it I notice and appreciate more and more details. Seriously, this is probably the best use of CGI I've seen in a movie, probably ever. That third act is some of the best Star Wars you can find; stunning visuals, high stake shootouts, references to other movies, and a lightsaber. What more could you want? This is definitely the best thing to come from Disney's acquiring of Star Wars (I haven't seen The Clone Wars or Mando Season 2 yet at the time of writing this). Also, I'm sure none of you noticed, but I skipped Solo for my rewatch. I do like it, just not enough to rewatch it.

A few minor story changes could have made this movie great; eliminate Holdo and replace her with Leia, actually have Luke on Crait and have him surrender himself to Kylo as Obi-Wan did to Vader, make the master codebreaker Lando, eliminate Rose (she wasn't that bad, I just think the movie could do without her character), etc. I really like the space scenes, some of my favorite aspects of Star Wars are the ships so I really enjoyed those sequences. Kylo is one of my favorite Star Wars characters, which is something this movie only improved on. By default, this is the best sequel movie, but it's not the best it could've been.

I was going to write this big review about how this movie is a lot like this one Christmas tradition my cousin and I have, but about halfway through I realized this movie wasn't worth that long of a review, so I'll instead leave you with this:

So much of this movie doesn't make sense, so much of this movie is unnecessary, it's horribly written, it cares too much about fan service, and Colin Trevorrow's Duel of Fates would have been a much better conclusion to the saga. I'm disappointed. 

Also, wouldn't a much better ending be if Kylo walked over to Rey's dead body, picked her up, and told her ""I will finish what you started""? It would have shown how his allegiance is with the light side now, while also referencing what he said to Vader's helmet in TFA. Rey would die, ending the Palpatine bloodline and truly destroying everything he created. Ben could then go on to lead the republic and pick up where his mother left off, continuing her legacy.

This is supposed to be a ""woman empowerment"" movie, right? If that's the case then why for half of the movie is she a bumbling idiot who needs a man to help her get around? Also they had to pick one of the most attractive and fit actresses in Hollywood and put her in some skimpy outfit so she can have some sex appeal. Not to mention the one female character who's shorter and a little larger is the butt of all the jokes she's in and has a job as a servant to a man. Tell me if I'm wrong, which I very well could be, but this movie seems to be a little counterintuitive to the ""woman empowerment"" movement. As for the movie itself, the direction, cgi, and editing are terrible. The action is nothing but extreme close-ups and speed-ramped garbage. There are a couple of good beats of actual characterization (gunner guy can't shoot, the guy speaks lots of languages), but besides that, the characters are uninteresting and feel unimportant to the story. They spend like 30 minutes in Themascara but then never revisit it for the rest of the film and don't give closure to that subplot. This movie fails to deliver the message it tries to convey and doesn't even make for a good movie while trying to do it.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2020-12-30
2020-12-30,Wonder Woman 1984,2020,https://boxd.it/1xUw7F,2,,"48/100

While it improved upon a lot of the problems I had with the first one, the story wasn't nearly as good. There were a lot of little subplots and things that were set up that never found a conclusion (like how the opening scene sets up Diana not cheating but never revisits that lesson) which is kind of ridiculous for them to not find time to do considering this thing is 151 gosh darn minutes long. I had a hard time getting through this and had to take multiple TikTok breaks before I was finally able to finish it. Kristen Wiig acts circles around everyone else on the cast, which isn't saying much as not even she delivered that great of a performance. As much as I love Pedro Pascal, he wasn't too hot either (hot as in good at acting, he was and always will be hot in the other sense of the word). Surprisingly, I found Steve's return to be done in a semi-satisfying way, which makes me curious as to how they'll inevitably bring him back for the next one. Speaking of which, that guy that they got to play Diana's love interest at the end stars almost exclusively in Hallmark Christmas movies so if the third one of these isn't about how a small-island goddess falls in love with a big city hunk and learns the true meaning of Christmas then I will not be watching it.

Don't get me wrong, I definitely enjoyed this, I just don't think it lives up to what I'm seeing everyone else make it up to be. The character designs were great but the animation was nothing special for Pixar's standards. The direction was mediocre, and the story felt like a culmination of the leftover plot points and ideas from Pete Doctor's previous project, Inside Out. The body switch genre has been beaten to death that it seems impossible to bring anything new to the table while doing it, which was no different here. The touching moments didn't really touch me, and besides a few good bits of humor, I didn't feel a whole lot of emotion while watching this. As much as it pains me to say it, I feel like Pixar might be losing their mojo.

Even as I get close to completing his filmography, it's nice to see Nolan continue to impress me with his work. The nonlinear storytelling is what really made this movie for me. The story itself is somewhat basic, but through the way that it is told it is able to become something much more. Guy Pierce was an excellent choice for this role. He plays the main character's rapid switches between dumb and intelligent really well. I am usually pretty good at predicting the end of a movie before it comes, and for a large majority of the movie, I thought I had done just that. So, when the end finally came, I was pleasantly surprised that it was an actual surprise and that I hadn't had guessed it. This is definitely one of those movies that would be really interesting to watch again. I don't want to watch it right away, but just enough that I forget the specifics of what happened while still being able to pick up on new details and get a better understanding of the film. In my opinion, this is some of the best Nolan has to offer. He has a few films that are better than this but purely based on style and story, this one takes the crown.

I have been a cinephile for a little over 2 years now, I have over 1,000 movies logged on this website, I plan to go to college for filmmaking in the fall, and I am only now watching The Godfather for the first time. This movie is very long. As much as I felt the runtime, each and every minute was necessary to the movie. There were a lot of slow parts, but it was only so the fast parts could really be worth it. This was the longest movie I've ever seen, but I've definitely watched ones that have felt longer. One complaint I have, while it is just a style choice, is how the passage of time is depicted. It's never directly said how much time has gone by between each scene, and sometimes it's long enough to get a little confused. One example is how the healing of wounds work. Al Pacino got punched in the face and had a bruise long enough to last him through moving to Sicily, meeting and marrying a woman, but when Marlin Brando gets shot 5 times in the back, he's up and back to normal in the matter of a few scenes. Another quick problem I had that correlates to my last point is how long it takes for people to die in this movie. Now I'm no expert, but I feel like a point-blank shot to the head wouldn't give you enough time to move your mouth around a little bit and react to what's happening. As for the things I did like, the acting, writing, and story were all phenomenal. For as popular and as esteemed as this movie is, I had no idea what it was about going in. This created such a unique watching experience that I rarely find with other movies. I was slowly able to realize why so many people love this movie so much. As for me, I also really liked it. It's not my favorite movie in the world, but I was definitely able to appreciate and realize why others do. I understand why this is considered to be the best movie of all time, I just don't necessarily agree. I'm not in any rush to watch the next 2 parts, I'd really like to see them, I just feel like I need to let this one simmer and cool down before I move on. If you haven't seen this before, don't make the same mistake I did and watch it.","w/dad, @ home, prime, journal entry, film studies",2021-01-24
2021-01-27,No Half Measures: Creating the Final Season of Breaking Bad,2013,https://boxd.it/1CmmKT,,,"Breaking Bad (4 stars, 84/100)

I won't attach a star rating to this until I've seen the actual documentary, but I will be using this review to give my thoughts on the show. I'll publish a second review once I watch the actual documentary this entry is for.

This show as a whole is one of the most captivating pieces of television I've ever seen. There are a lot of plot holes and story points that I'm not a fan of, but there's still a ton to enjoy. Performances are great from the whole cast and the writing is top-notch. My favorite character has to be Gus. His demeanor and overall attitude are so compelling and are perfectly executed by Giancarlo Esposito. His death was my favorite of the series and was the only moment to actually get a reaction out of me. I've gone back and watched that clip of him walking out of the room a couple of times now just because of how amazing of a moment it is. My favorite episodes are as follows; Face-Off, Grilled, 4 Days Out, and Sunset.

Season One (4 stars, 83/100)

A strong start to the series, and I'm excited to keep watching. The final episode was a little weak in terms of a conclusion but it was a great season nonetheless. Some of the tension wasn't there as I already knew what was going to happen, which will, unfortunately, being a reoccurring thing as I continue watching the parts I've already seen. Bryan Cranston is an outstanding actor and is crazy good in this role. Time to start season 2.

Season Two (4 stars, 84/100)

I just finished season two in about two days; Breaking Bad is like blue sky to me. Season two started out strong but slowly dwindled down as the season went on. My favorite episode of the show so far, Grilled, was nothing short of amazing. Some other notable moments are 4 Days Out, Walter giving Walter Jr. the tequila, the introduction of Gus, Hank as a whole, Skyler revealing she knows Walt has a second phone, etc. On the downside, I feel like a few plot holes came up throughout the season that really brought the show down for me. Another thing I didn't like was how unsatisfying the ""big reveal"" of the plane crash was at the end of the season. They build it up as this huge mysterious thing and then reveal it all in like 5 minutes. Something else was the therapist that they introduced in season one that never appeared again. They set him up to be an important character but he was never seen or referenced in the second season. Besides that, this season was pretty good and I can't wait to start season 3.

Season 3 (4 stars, 84/100)

Right off the bat, I hate how poorly this season built off the finale of the second one. They almost never reference the airplane crash again after the first episode, and the dad isn't even seen once. I also feel like the relationship between Walt and Jessie got a little repetitive in the beginning. Besides that, this season wasn't too bad. It had a really strong back half and included two of my favorite episodes, Sunset and Fly.

Season 4 (4 stars, 85/100)

Season 4 is my favorite so far, but it doesn't go without its flaws. I feel like Hank should've been a little more suspicious of Walter after all that he's done, especially after the car crash. I also feel like Hank's recovery was a little quick. I mean realistically I don't think you'd be able to recover from 4 gunshots in the span of a couple of months. Perhaps I'm just nitpicking, but it's just something that stood out to me. One thing I did like was the overall plot of this season. The relationship between Walter, Jessie, and Gus was super interesting and was the main reason I continued to watch. Speaking of Gus, his death, while a little unrealistic, was nuts. I love seeing him get mad, it feels so raw and unhinged, and seeing him die the way he did was both satisfying and crazy cool. If it only gets better from here, I eagerly await my finishing of season five.

Season 5 (4 stars, 83/100)

Season 5, in my opinion, was a bit lackluster compared to the other seasons. It had some good moments, and the story was more solid, but I just didn't really connect with it. One thing I did enjoy was the little bits of suspense they were able to include. There was a shot in ep14 where it's unclear whether Skyler is going to grab a knife or a phone, and there's a bit in ep16 where Walter keeps his hands in his pockets to hide whether he has a gun or not. I found Mike's death unsatisfactory, Hank's wasn't a huge deal/surprise to me, and all the other characters hadn't been around long enough for me to care about them. Speaking of which, in order to fill the void of all the characters they killed in previous seasons, they brought in a bunch of new ones. These extra characters, along with the direction of the story, made this season feel like a bit of a venture from the other seasons, which was unfavorable in my opinion. Felina, which is hyped up to be the best episode of TV ever, didn't really do it for me. It was fine as a season finale but wasn't anything too special and was by no means my favorite episode of the series. I'm going to start watching El Camino right away, but I think I'll take a little bit before I start Better Call Saul.","w/ myself, @ home, netflix",

Wait- do I enjoy this more than I did the majority of Breaking Bad? I'm sure this wouldn't be as good if I had watched it by itself, but starting it right after finishing Breaking Bad made it really enjoyable. It kind of just felt like a long episode of Breaking Bad, It provided great closure for Jessie and did so in a very satisfying way. Usually, I'd call bringing back old characters fan service, but it felt very fitting here and I didn't mind it. Solid flick, and a great way to finish my Breaking Bad watch through.","w/ myself, @ home, netflix",2021-01-27

I always love getting a peek behind the curtains, and when you get to peek at one of the best shows ever made, it's really, really cool. The work that gets put into a single episode of Breaking Bad is insane. Watching all the components of the show come together to make something amazing is watching filmmaking at its finest. The cutaways with the cast and crew were cool too. I always like seeing actor's personalities and this was no exception.

I’m not a huge history buff and therefore am not a huge war movie fan but there were definitely still some aspects of this that I was able to enjoy. The performances and writing were both phenomenal, and the overall production design was some of the best I’ve seen. One thing I really liked was how the beginning and the end feel like completely different movies. The first half is raw and loud, and the second half is eerie and quiet. Coppola did a great job stitching them together in a satisfying way. Another thing I liked was how raw the depiction of war is in this movie. They don’t hold back anything while showing how gruesome some aspects were, how in the wrong the US was in some parts, and how crazy war can drive people. I definitely want to watch this again, the more I think about it the more I begin to appreciate it.","@ michael's, w/ michael, w/ ryan, w/ john, dvd",2021-01-29

With the loss of the main cast, director, and sense of style from the first one, this feels more like a soft reboot than a sequel. Everything I liked about the first one is completely gone here. Despite having 10x more monsters and 10x more CGI shots, this movie is still incredibly boring. It's basically just a bunch of world-building intertwined with a storyline and with characters I have zero interest in. I only watched this to prepare myself for Godzilla vs Kong, which it seems like that's the only reason the studio made this movie as they referenced Kong like 7 times.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2021-01-30

This feels like a movie that was written by a couple of high schoolers over the span of ten years. There are a lot of jokes and lines of dialogue that sound like they came from the mind of the people who were saying them. That is absolutely not a critique, as I feel like it adds to the overall vibe of the movie. This is one of the raunchiest, funniest, and most essential coming of age movies cinema has to offer.","w/ jack, @jack's, netflix",2021-01-31
2021-02-02,King Kong,2005,https://boxd.it/1DdpX3,3.5,Yes,"76/100

The beginning oozes with 30s charm, the middle is riddled with non-stop crazy action sequences, and the end is... well boring. This movie is an astounding 3 hours and 20 minutes long, and for the most part, I didn't feel it at all. It wasn't until they returned back to New York that I started to lose interest. For as long as this movie is, they were still unable to show how they got Kong back to New York from the island, which seems like a pretty big plot point to gloss over. Most of the main characters were absent from the third act which made the ending pretty unsatisfying. Another problem I have is how repetitive it can get at parts. The ""I'm about to die, but another stronger character saves me at the last second"" trope is used 4 or 5 times in this movie. For all that negative, there is still plenty of positive. The CGI is very impressive for 2005's standards, and the use of it to make a giant gorilla fight three different tyrannosaurus rexes is crazy cool. I had a hell of a time watching this movie, and if it weren't for that lackluster third act then I would have rated this much higher. I find it funny that I've seen this movie twice before I've seen any of Peter Jackson's other movies. I should probably get around to that.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2021-02-01

The editing in this movie is so bad it's annoying. I actually really enjoyed this movie. It has some gorgeous cinematography, a great cast, and a mediocre story. Maybe if the editing wasn't so jarring I actually might have been able to enjoy it. Seriously, if it weren't for the horrendous editing this would've been an easy 3.5/4. On the bright side, one thing I really liked in this movie was the skullcrawlers. The character design is impeccable; those things are actually crazy terrifying. I also really enjoyed the cast. I love movies like this where every character is an A-lister. John C Reilly was one stand out performance as he was great in his role and managed to make me both laugh and well-up. I absolutely love the 70's setting and aesthetic that was chosen for this film. The only downside is that it means none of these characters will be able to return for Godzilla vs Kong, a movie I am very excited about, by the way. 

Also, this movie reminded me how hot Brie Larson is so uh bonus points for that.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2021-02-01

The story alone would have been enough to keep me intrigued, but the way that this is told is so unique and captivating; it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. I really appreciate the efforts to remain true to the real-life story. There were a couple of parts where the narrative felt a little choppy or unnatural, but I can't even complain about that as it's literally how it happened in real life. Another great thing about this movie is the performances. I had seen most of the cast members in other roles before but these ones are by far the most impressive. There's not much else I can say about this except go watch it. Watch this movie. Its unique storytelling format is enough to watch the movie alone, but the story it's telling is crazy captivating and makes for an astounding movie all around.","w/ myself, @ home, prime",2021-02-03

For every crazy action scene, there are like 5 plot holes and gaps in logic. This, in my opinion, really makes this movie hard to enjoy. One thing I do like is Dom's character in this movie, especially towards the end. He has some badass lines of dialogue that I quite liked. I also really liked Shaw compared to the last one. He became a much more likable character and I really enjoyed his scene with the baby on the airplane. Listen, I watch these movies for a fun time, not a good time. But when I can't even have fun while watching it, and am constantly distracted by pathetic world building, then I have a problem.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2021-02-04

Promising Young Woman has a strong and important message, which I think may be the main reason people like this so much. The story is unsatisfying every step of the way and constantly leaves a bad taste in your mouth. There are a couple of good bits here or there, but they are ruined anytime you take a step back and look at the wider picture. Bo Burnam's character is funny, well-acted, and the perfect counterpart to Carey Mulligan's. (steps back) But that is ruined by making him the villain just for a sweet gotcha moment in the end. The dialogue is great across the board, (steps back), but it's awkwardly stitched together and makes it hard to watch. The cinematography was nice, I'll give them that, but that's about the only redeeming quality without a negative side effect. The ending is very unfavorable and does a terrible job at completing story arcs. At the height of this movie, I was ready to rate it a 4, but as I continued watching, and as I reflected while writing this review, I talked myself down to a 3. So much wasted potential.

Going in Style is pretty mundane, but I don't know what else I expected from a movie about 3 old dudes robbing a bank. The stakes were pretty low the entire movie, and it never got suspenseful or tense.

Full transparency, I did watch this movie over the span of three days, so my opinions and overall thoughts might be a little hazy. It was refreshing to see some actual characters in a heist movie. There are plenty of movies out there that make their characters interesting but none as fleshed out as this one. There were a couple of lines involving political commentary that really stand out, but the intentions were good, so I can't get too mad at it. Overall this movie is a nice spin on the heist genre. It did something entirely different, while still satisfying all of the expectations I have going into a heist movie. This is my first Spike Lee movie, and since I enjoyed this one I'll definitely be returning for more.","w/ myself, @ home, peacock",2021-02-14

War Dogs feels like it tries too hard to be The Wolf of Wall Street, and from reading other reviews, I'm not the only one who has this opinion.

I love the simplistic Wes Anderson style that all of his movies have. It's hard to describe what exactly makes a Wes Anderson movie so unique; maybe it's the colors, maybe it's the dialogue, but I think the inability to pinpoint exactly what it is is part of why they're so special. 

Admittedly, this one did get a bit boring towards the middle, but everything else was so entertaining and charming that I can't hate on it too much. 

The performances were quirky, the story was fresh, and it all made for a good watch. I've been slowly watching Anderson's filmography over the past year and a half, and as much as I'd love to binge them, I think being able to watch them as one-off experiences every couple of months allows them to stand out among the other movies I've been watching and feel like something special.

I think my favorite part about this movie is Wes Anderson's use of stop motion animation. He's able to get shots he wouldn't otherwise be able to do in live-action. I think this is the way animation should be used; to break the boundaries of filmmaking and accomplish things you wouldn't be able to do in other mediums. By doing this, Anderson is able to create a very unique look and style which really brings this movie to life and makes it what it is. Charm and charisma aside, this movie is a solid 4 stars. There is some great dialogue courtesy of Noah Baumbach, some great direction by Wes Anderson, but it's in the story where my issues with this movie lay. Little gaps in story-building bring the movie down for me. They're pretty nit-picky, but they really stood out in my opinion. Besides that, this movie is a masterpiece, and I have nothing more to say about it.

Wow. Talk about an underappreciated hidden gem. Only 5k people have seen this and it's honestly one of the most enjoyable and most unique movies I've seen in a while. The first 6 minutes especially are some of the best pieces of film I've ever seen, period. Full transparency, the third act is a little weak but the first two more than make up for it. There's so much to enjoy about this movie: the editing, the cinematography, the score, the WRITING... it's all just so good (for real though, the writing is fantastic. The amount of jokes I laughed out loud at is remarkable). If I somehow haven't sold you on it yet, about halfway through the movie, I literally paused it, looked up at my wall, and sat in silence until I out loud said to myself ""this movie is so good"", a reaction I have only gotten out of a movie once before. If you have 90 minutes to spare and are looking for something good to watch look no further. This movie rocks and I cannot wait to watch it again.","w/ myself, @ home, netflix",2021-02-16

I originally only watched this to complete my Golden Globes watchlist but it ended up being a lot better than I expected. Sure, it had every kids movie cliche in the book but the animation was surprisingly stunning and it had some very favorable music choices, even though they milked the hell out of them. This felt like the right next step for a The Croods sequel and I'm curious what they'll do should they make another one.

Another movie I only watched to complete my Golden Globes Noms watchlist. For starters, it was way longer than it needed to be, the music was generic and nothing special (apart from that number in the mall, it perfectly epitomizes my thoughts on Christianity and I enjoyed it thoroughly), the message had a pretty weak and contradictory delivery, the performances were boring, the story lacked logic and had a lot of plot holes, etc. I'm not really big on musicals, and this movie certainly didn't help their reputation. Also, is James Cordon doing shitty musical reboots going to be an annual December tradition from now on? I mean first cats now this...

Nomadland is beautiful in its simplicity. Not a whole lot happens narratively, as it follows a singular woman through her quiet, lonely life, but that doesn't mean it's boring. Despite its slow pace, Nomadland moves quite quickly in terms of viewing. There's so much to digest with each line and each shot; it's truly a work of art. It may not be my favorite of the year, but it's certainly close. Cloe Zhao's work was impeccable and I look forward to seeing what she does with The Eternals later this year.

I always feel dumb criticizing movies that are universally loved as I feel like I'm missing something. That being said, here are my grievances. I loved the first two acts, but the third is disappointing and needlessly open-ended. There are a couple of jarring story issues such as how could Woddy Harrelson possibly have known where Josh Brolin was when he hunted him to the Mexican hotel and what were the chances the one hotel Javier Bardem happened to drive by with the tracker was the one where Borlin was staying in. That being said, the suspense is top-notch in this movie. There were several instances where I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next shot to be fired. Bardem and Brolin's performances were both stellar, definitely the best I've seen from both of them. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, I just happened to have enjoyed the three episodes of 30 Rock I watched after this a lot more than I did the actual movie.","w/dad, @ home, netflix",2021-02-23

I had a hard time getting through this movie. The first half was painfully slow and the black and white palate, while a good choice stylistically for the movie, made it boring to watch. Maybe I'm just spoiled by movies like Straight Up or The Grand Budapest Hotel that have so much color it's hard not to have your eyes glued to the screen the entire time because Mank had such a dull viewing experience for me. The performances were nothing special and I honestly just feel like Mank wasn't special or unique enough of a person to make a movie about. However, this is definitely Fincher's best shot film. Every shot is so smooth and clever; it's probably this movie's biggest redeeming quality.

A very unique story executed pretty well. Rosamund Pike gave an excellent performance and I hope they remember it when The Oscars hopefully come around later this year. The colors, although a bit much at times, were otherwise great and added a nice touch to my viewing experience. I liked the music but it didn't always fit into the scene it was placed in; it often made slow parts needlessly tense and tense parts awkwardly slow. It's an enjoyable movie and a huge step up from J Blakeson's prior works. If he continues on this trend, I'm excited to see what he does next.","w/ myself, @ home, netflix",2021-02-24

This movie is interesting in the way that it throws you into the middle of the story at the very beginning without much context. I was skeptical at first, not having any clue who the characters were or what the setting they were interacting in was but I slowly came around to it. After all, it is film-making techniques like these that keep the industry fresh and break the mold. Speaking of breaking the mold, this might be the most unconventional romantic movie I've ever seen. Not only in the way that it tackles homosexuality, but in the setting, the setup, and the progression of the story. It manages to dodge pretty much every cliche in the book. The performances were great, especially from Armie Hammer, and the music was enjoyable as well. The monologue between Timothy and his father towards the end was beautiful. I loved the way the father handled it and it was a perfect example of this movie dodging cliches. ""love is love"" chef's kiss. The ending was solid too, I think it was the right conclusion to the story and only aided in the movie's uniqueness. I think my main complaint would be that this movie is way too horny. There was a solid hour in the middle of the movie where there was a sex scene every five minutes. Not to mention how explicit it gets at times. Like I'm here to enjoy some quality filmmaking, if I wanted to watch two men cum on each other I'd visit a different site. Perhaps that's a nitpicky and unusual critique but it's something that stood out to me and made the film quite boring and repetitive at parts. As attracted as I can be to men, there's only so much footage of Timothy Chalamet jerking off into a peach that I can handle.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2021-02-26

Minutes felt like a student film. The writing was basic, the ambition was large, and it all came together in an okay fashion. I think the one-take format was a nice touch to an otherwise stylistically dry movie, but I was really only impressed by it in the first short. I feel like some sort of coherence between the shorts could've made it feel like more of a solid piece; repeat actors, repeat moral of the story, etc. Otherwise, it just feels like a collection of decent shorts, nothing special about it. I think my favorite short was the first one, with it only getting worse from there. This was my first Jim Cummings film. I'm intrigued by his ambition and eagerness to experiment with this piece so I'm eager to watch some of his other work now too.","w/ myself, @ home, prime",2021-03-02

Beautiful colors and cinematography but I have a lot of trouble getting behind the story. There are so many details that are brushed over and plot points that are way too far-fetched for the world this movie has built itself. The editing in the first act was utter trash for some reason but thankfully it fixed itself by the second. Fincher had me hooked with Zodiac and Panic Room but everything I've watched since then just hasn't been up to par.

Speed Racer lacks in story and character development but makes up for it 100x times over due to its visuals and race scenes. Every damn shot looks like Robert Rodriguez took an acid tablet and came onto a canvas and I love every second of it. The editing, or more specifically, the transitions are fucking wild and caught me off guard every time one flew across the screen. This brought me a lot of nostalgia as my brother and I were big fans of Speed Racer when we were younger and would always watch the animated movies and collect the matchbox cars. Is this the best movie ever when it comes to story? No. Is this the best movie ever when it comes to entertainment value, visual effects, and cinematography? Probably.

WandaVision had a promising start but ended up being a bunch of glorified filler with a mediocre ending. I'm happy we got to see some Marvel stuff for the first time in a year and a half but it ended up being a huge letdown.

Episode One (3 Stars, 64/100) 8

A lackluster and uninteresting start to the show. I know it wasn't meant to be this way, but this is the first piece of MCU content we've gotten since Spider-man: Far From Home all the way back in July 2019, so my expectations were a bit high for this. I appreciate they're staying true to the style of television they're replicating, but it would've been cool if they did it on film, too. This episode was painfully mediocre, so hopefully, they only get better from here. Oh, and it's pretty annoying how the credits are 7 minutes long with no post-credit scene. It really throws off the runtime and made me waste a couple of minutes thinking there was something to be waiting for.

Episode Two (3 stars, 66/100) 7

This episode really isn't any better than the last one; a lot of my complaints still stand. The only good parts were the little bits where the outside reality started to poke in and Wanda breaks character for a second. I also like how when Wanda tried to tell Vision about it, the laugh track played, almost as if the world that they're living in is trying to devalue their discovery or something. I'm excited for next week, I'm optimistic that it does get better, hopefully by exploring all the S.W.O.R.D. stuff we saw in the trailers.

Episode Three (3 stars, 61/100) 9

As much as I enjoyed finally getting a glimpse at the outside world and see Wanda's reality start to crack, this is my least favorite episode yet. The writing and acting were not very good in my opinion, and it was hard for me to find myself invested in what was happening. I'm not used to watching TV shows, let alone TV shows from this era, so perhaps I'm missing some perspective when it comes to this TV show. It's nice to see Marvel doing something different from the usual shenanigans in their movies, but in my opinion, it isn't really working out. Oh, and it annoyed the absolute crap out of me that one of Vision's collars was untucked the whole episode. How does that happen for the entire episode? Did they film this in a day? Maybe I'm missing a reference or something but I could not take my eyes off that every time he came on screen.

Episode Four (4 Stars, 82/100) 1

Finally something interesting! This episode acted as a behind-the-scenes for the previous three which was a really fresh idea. The opening was super cool to see as I always love world-building like that, plus the blip wasn't something we saw a whole lot of besides some iPhone footage in Far From Home. I think my favorite scene from the whole episode though is watching the television correct itself for Kat and Jimmy, then cutting to see what we missed the last episode due to the cut. Plus that shot of dead Vision was crazy cool and it makes me wonder if Wanda is actually using his dead body as a puppet or something. Imagine if at the end once that's revealed we go back and rewatch old scenes only it's Vision's dead body and Wanda is playing with it like a doll. One critique would be that this episode does kind of ruin the ambiguity and momentum the show had going for it so far, but I feel like it was necessary for the progression of the show. I'm really excited moving forward now; this show has proven that it's unlike anything Marvel has done before, plus it seems like we're only getting started in terms of how cool this show is going to get. You've got my attention now!

Episode 5 (3.5 Stars, 78/100) 2

HolyshitholyshitholyshitholyshitholyshitHOLYSHIT! That last scene literally had my jaw on the floor. I'm crazy excited to see how this plays out, and whether they'll have him back as a reoccurring character or not once this is all over. With the recent spidey news, I'm curious how Marvel explains this. Alternate universe? Coincidence they look the same? Whatever it is, I'm all for it as long as it's a neat explanation. Also, Agnes is really starting to act suspicious... I'm not entirely sure she didn't kill that dog herself...

Episode 6 (3.5 Stars, 76/100) 4

I have no idea where this is going lmao. All of my theories have turned belly up. Also that Kick-Ass joke was meta as fuck.

Episode 7 (3 Stars, 68/100) 6

The actual meat of the episode was pretty boring but those last five minutes and the post-credit scene were nuts. I swear this show makes time fly like no other.

Episode 8 (3.5 Stars, 78/100) 3

I really enjoyed this episode because it revealed everything we've been wanting to know but I also didn't like this episode because it revealed everything we've wanted to know. All of the tension and ambiguity is gone as this episode pulled the curtain on every mystery we've been presented with from the first 7 episodes, only leaving behind the questions this episode posed to be answered in the finale. Wanda's backstory was fun to see but it didn't really add any new information to what we already knew about it. I'm interested to see how this ends and what ""the big cameo"" is, even though I'm 99% positive it's Doctor Strange. This will be the last episode I review on this entry as I'm going to rewatch the entire show and write all new reviews in preparation for the finale.

Episode 9 (3.5 stars, 75/100) 5

Underwhelming. A lot of questions were answered last week so most of the show's momentum was gone and didn't have a whole lot to explore for the finale. The only questions there were to answer were the ones posed in the last episode, which wasn't even that interesting to begin with. White Vision is a weird loose end that I don't really know what they're going to do with. It was time for Vision to die. He had a great scene in Infinity War and he had a great farewell here, so if they bring him back somehow I'm gonna be mad. There was this huge hype for a giant cameo in this episode, one that Paul Bettany described as ""someone who he has always wanted to work with"" and ""someone with who he has a lot of fireworks with"". While it is clever that the cameo ended up being him, it's a huge letdown. They did this earlier in the season too with the Aerospace Engineer. They hyped it up for 2 episodes only for it to be some write-off character. The Ralph Bohner joke was funny but it's a complete waste of Evan Peters. I loved him in the 6th episode and it's a shame they didn't use him more. He ended up being ""Ralph"" which doesn't even work well story-wise. Speaking of characters that weren't used, I feel like Darcy, Woo, and Maria were both criminally underused. They barely had any screen time and the show didn't set them up for any future in any other projects. As a whole, this show was a disappointment. It took so long to do so little and it's so unsatisfying. I know this is a lot of negativity for 9 in the morning but it's so frustrating. Hopefully, the other shows end up better, I have high hopes for Loki.","w/ myself, @ home, @ school, disney+",

Memories of Murder is the fifth movie I've seen by Bong Joon-Ho - I'm beginning to think this guy is incapable of making a bad movie. I mean sure, it has its issues here or there, but I really enjoyed my watch and it reminded me a lot of Zodiac, which just so happens to be my favorite film. The way clues are discovered, the time-jumping, the complex plot, it's all reminiscent of Fincher's thriller classic, even though this one was released first. One detail in particular that I liked is how the colors slowly got duller and darker as the movie went on and the detectives slowly became hopeless. The first shot opens with bright yellow fields, the scenes towards the ends were almost entirely black and white, and once we revisit Detective Park 20 years later, we see the bright yellow fields again. It's little details like these that make me love the art of filmmaking. I felt the runtime a bit in the beginning but as the movie went on I become more hooked. The more I think about it, the fewer things I can think of to complain about. Memories of Murder is by no means a perfect movie, but since I can't really pinpoint what I don't like about it, is it that far off?","w/ myself, @ home, prime, foreign",2021-03-07

Zodiac is one of those movies that could be 5 hours longer and still have me hooked the whole time. This is my third time watching Zodiac, and each line of dialogue and each twist still hit just as hard as they did the first two times. Zodiac is by far Fincher's best film. The suspense, the pacing; it's unmatched. Not to mention the excellent performances from everyone all around.

Edgar Wright NEVER disappoints. This was the last in the Cornetto Trilogy that I had to watch with dad and he seemed to enjoy it so I, therefore, did too. I love the way how each pub is kind of its own little chapter in the movie. One substantial plot point happens each pub visit and it does wonders for the pacing. The writing is witty and clever, the story, while dwindles out a bit at the end, is absurdly unique and entertaining, and the movie as a whole is just so much damn fun. I go back and forth between this and Hot Fuzz being my favorite in the Cornetto trilogy, and as of right now, it's this. I've made a point to rewatch this trilogy each year and I have full intentions of continuing that tradition until the day I die. Boy, do I love Edgar Wright.","w/dad, @ home, dvd",2021-03-08

As if the ""Kubrick Stare"" wasn't enough, Alexander Delarge's insanity was also shown through his habit of casually drinking milk.

A Clockwork Orange had a great start, as I really liked the first act. The action scenes were fun and well-directed, the dialogue was clever and the set design was... interesting. Unfortunately for me, the movie took a turn. Usually, I like plot shifts, take The World's End for example. But for some reason, it just didn't work for me here. The fun, mentally unstable vigilante became a boring, less mentally unstable cellmate. The shots were expertly crafted the whole way through and the cinematography never got boring to look at.

Despite its two-and-a-half-hour runtime, not a whole lot happens narratively; I could probably explain the entire plot to you in about 30 seconds. Instead of focusing on the story, 2001 focuses much more on visual effects. Every shot is a masterpiece in its composition. The visual effects were groundbreaking for their time and a whole 53 years later they're still so fucking good. The exterior shots of the spaceship in space and that final trip are prime examples. The score was more iconic than I expected; every piece was recognizable and is still reused in media today. There are things that I could critique, but as I said earlier this is more of a piece of art than it is a movie, and since I know nothing about art, I feel like I have no place criticizing it. I'm not going to attach a number rating like I do to all my other reviews, and will instead rate it based on my viewing experience.

I have a lot of grievances with Zack Snyder's Man of Steel, but for some reason, they don't really bother me. I'd say this movie is my guilty pleasure, but I don't even feel guilty about it. 

I hate how it spends way too much time on Krypton, starts like 9 different times, jumps around way too much at the beginning, has nauseating cinematography, and a really boring and unoriginal final fight, but for some reason, I walked away enjoying my time. 

Lois was really well written in the first act; listening to her talk and act like a bitch was actually a bit infuriating to watch. This was the only good bit of writing in this whole movie though, as the rest was weak and often cringy and the Lois bit wasn't continued much after the one-hour mark. 

I liked how there were mixes of the alien invasion subgenre of horror mixed in, it was a nice touch and added a bit of ""realism"" to the story. 

I'll be watching BvS and the original Justice League in preparation for the Snyder cut, which I am excited for only because Batman swears and I have nothing else to be hyped about in this movie drought of the last year.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2021-03-17
2021-03-19,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2016,https://boxd.it/1JrX49,3,Yes,"64/100

While Zack Snyder did improve upon some of my problems with Man Of Steel, a whole new batch came to light in BvS. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to like here; I love Jessie Eisenberg's Lex Luthor and all of the monologing and scoring that came along with it. 

I think a lot of the writing was weak and struggled to find ""depth"", as usually when a character attempted to deliver a deep or thought-provoking line, it came off as something from a r/iam14andthisisdeep shit post. 

I think DC may have jumped the gun a bit on this movie. There were way too many characters to introduce in too little time. The constant bouncing back and forth between characters with varying levels of character development was tiring and got old after a while. 

The first two times I watched this movie, I wasn't too bothered by the Martha plot line but boy did I hate it this time. The moment where we see a crack in Bruce's timidness and it flashes back to him holding flowers at his parent's funeral seemed so jarring and out of place. it definitely did not match the tone of the rest of the movie. 

I am really getting sick of giant CGI-ridden fight scenes to close a movie. The fight between Batman and Superman was fine, but when they went up again Doomsday the whole thing became a giant grey and orange mess. It was boring to watch and had zero entertainment value. Also, can we talk about how quickly Metropolis rebuilt? I mean look at the condition of that place in Man of Steel; the city was leveled. Yet 18 months later and it's perfectly built back to the way it was before?? Bonkers. 

I watched the extended cut this time around to see what all the hype was about. In my opinion, the scenes that were added for this edition should've just been left out. They ruined the pacing and didn't add enough to the story for them to make sense to stay in. There are parts I liked, and there were parts I disliked. Right now, the parts I disliked are shining brighter in my head so that's why I'm writing such a negative review. Maybe once it sits for a while I'll change my mind (probably not). Time to watch The Snyder Cut I guess.","w/ myself, @ home, @ school, sparrow, director's cut",2021-03-18
2021-03-20,Hunt for the Wilderpeople,2016,https://boxd.it/1JCvHp,4,Yes,"82/100

As I've said in plenty of reviews before, if my dad laughs during a movie I'm showing him, I'm guaranteed to give it a high rating. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is Taika Waititi's best film yet in my opinion. My dad's all-time favorite movie is Thor Ragnorak so naturally, I had to show him this one. While HftW didn't surpass Ragnorak for him as it did for me, he still seemed to have enjoyed his time, so I, therefore, did too. 

I think one thing this movie struggles with is tone. Every sad moment is immediately ruined by a bit of comedy. Taika's sense of humor is brilliant and never fails to make me laugh if used correctly. There's a lot of heart in this movie if you let it sink in. The passing of the Aunt and the dog, the bonding between Ricky and Hector, just each moment where you're presented with an opportunity to appreciate it, a joke comes along and ruins the mood. For example, when the aunt died, I started to well up, but it immediately cut to Taika Waititi dressed up as a priest and I burst out laughing. 

Another place where I take issue with the tone is the ending. The whole movie has been built as this quiet, script and style-driven story, only to be ruined by a car chase and needless action. If I were at the helm, I would've done it in a comedic old-timey western-style face-off, it would've much better matched the rest of the movie and would've allowed for some of that style and humor to creep in. Besides that, I love this movie heaps, and I can't wait to show WWDITS to dad next.","w/dad, @ home, netflix",2021-03-19
2021-03-21,Zack Snyder's Justice League,2021,https://boxd.it/1JGbWn,3,,"68/100

There's a lot to digest and I'm not sure if I have any firm opinion on anything. There were definitely improvements from the original version, but there were also some unneeded parts too. I think the best version of this movie would come from each of the characters having a solo movie beforehand. It would seriously decrease the length of the runtime and allow for the characters to have full-fledged, nonrushed arcs and not detract from the story. 

I think another improvement would've been not having Superman return. Killing him in his second movie and bringing him back in his third seems a bit redundant. Plus, they didn't really need him to defeat Steppenwolf. 

I also didn't really like the epilogue. It felt tacked on for fan service and didn't give us any clues as to when we'll get answers to the questions it posed. 

The aspect ratio seemed pretentious and unneeded, but I stopped noticing it after the first five minutes so I'm not too bothered by it. 

One thing that did bother me though was how often shots went into bullet time. Anytime something remotely action-oriented happened there were at least 5 or 6 shots where things went into slow motion. It got really old really fast and ruined some of the scenes for me. 

There were a lot of little things I did like, but listing them all would take ages. 

It's just interesting that something like this exists. It's like a video game releasing a patch to fix bugs, except a studio sunk $70 million into making a version that's only a little better. I'm hoping rereleases like this don't become a norm for Hollywood, but then again, I think seeing this come to fruition was a byproduct of the studio having nothing else to do during covid. It's a lot to break down, and I'm sure my thoughts will change as I think about it more over the coming days.

2021-03-24,Cherry,2021,https://boxd.it/1K7YWl,3,,"68/100

Cherry is a hard movie to critique. I loved the style they went for, it was unique and added a nice flair to the movie, but they didn't put any effort into maintaining it the entire time and it felt out of place for the story they were trying to tell. 

The chapters that they broke the movie up into were clearly an attempt to cover the fact that this movie has no real focus. Is it about the opioid epidemic like the directors implied? Then why does it take an hour to get to that point? Is it about the effects of war on a person? Then why does the movie only spend 45 minutes on that? 

Essentially, the problem that this movie faces is who is its audience. I mean I guess you could argue it's to raise awareness for the causes of opioids, but then again I think the people who are interested in taking or are already taking opioids aren't spending their money on Apple TV+. 

Like I said before, I did enjoy the style. For example, the cinematography was great. There's a POV shot from inside of Tom Holland's ass towards the beginning which is nasty and should never be utilized in any film ever again, but besides that, there's a lot of great stuff in here. There's a long one-take towards the end which is nothing short of amazing, and a lot of the shots in the desert during the war sequences are great too. 

On top of that, the fourth wall breaking was a nice touch, and the editing offered some new techniques I hadn't seen before. All they had to do was be consistent with these things throughout the entire movie and they would've earned my respect; now when I look back on them they seem out of place. 

The performances were great as well. I used to think of Tom Holland as this wannabe drama star who wasn't meant for anything more than the light-hearted action limelight, but after seeing him give killer performances in The Devil All the Time and especially now Cherry, I'm beginning to think otherwise. Hopefully he breaks free from trashy action movies (not you Marvel, yes you Chaos Walking), as I'd love to see how far he can take himself. 

At the end of the day, I enjoyed my watch. It had bank heist aspects that I loved, nice story progression; I think the thing to take away from this is that you need more than just a sad story to make a movie good. I wouldn't be surprised to find myself revisiting this a couple of years down the line.

2021-03-29,Bad Trip,2021,https://boxd.it/1KOoxv,3,,"63/100

I love hidden camera shows and movies; Impractical Jokers is one of my all-time favorite shows, and Borat was one of my favorites from last year. However, the way that Impractical Jokers handles this genre of film is by getting the people they are pranking to laugh along with them, opposed to making them uncomfortable or scaring them. This is where Bad Trip differentiates. A large majority of the pranks featured in this movie were to make the people they were pranking feel uncomfortable. Tiffany Haddish's character's main goal was to scare anyone she came across, and Eric Andre's was to make them feel as awkward as possible. This approach to the genre had me on edge the whole movie. Anytime the people felt uncomfortable, I was right there with them. Admittedly, there were a few moments that got me to chuckle (that gorilla scene especially), but for the most part, I cringed more than I laughed. Eric Andre is a comedic genius, the work he's done on his show is brilliant, and while I can appreciate what he's done here on Bad Trip, it just seems that the way that his sense of humor is translated into this genre isn't my cup of tea.

I think my favorite aspect of the movie is each time it presented me with information, I took it as the truth, but each time the story took a twist it retconed that information. It's hard to explain without spoiling, but those who have seen it will understand. Anthony Hopkins is stellar in this movie; probably the best I've seen him apart from maybe SotL. It's a captivating story fueled by great performances. It deserves every Oscar it's awarded.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2021-03-30

Once you look past the flashy lighting and the nauseating cinematography, the only things that Godzilla vs. Kong leave you with are characters and a story more hollow than the earth they live on. 

I didn't go into this movie expecting well-written character arcs and a well-constructed story but I was somehow still let down. The only depth any of these characters had was that someone close to them died, which was explored for no more than two lines apiece. 

The story was too much at one time. I'm thankful for this movie's relatively short run time but it didn't give them a whole lot of time to work with. The pacing was all off, the end was very abrupt, there was too much exposition when there didn't need to be and too little when there did, and not a single character had a cohesive arc. 

As for the story, the movie gives no reason as to why Godzilla has suddenly started attacking. The last time we saw him, he was crowned king of the titans, which come to think of it, all of the other titans featured in the last one are noticeably and awkwardly absent from this movie. There's so much this movie just doesn't address. 

The cinematography had a few cool shots here or there but for the most part, it was a giant CGI mess. The camera was constantly doing 360s, which made the action really hard to follow. I wish more monster movies took a page out of Pacific Rim's book. Every shot of something big in that movie is captured from a ""realistic"" angle. Even entirely CGI shots are made to look like they were taken from the ground or a helicopter. In this movie, the camera has no anchor. It's constantly swinging around doing impossible angles which not only made most of the fight scenes messy and hard to follow but also ruined the sense of scale. We're never shown shots of them fighting from way up high or way down low so it's hard to really judge just how much damage and just how big these guys are. Something that I thought of to fix this would be to use a tilt-shift lens during some of the fight scenes. It would be great for getting a sense of scale but it would also just be a nice touch cinematography-wise. 

One thing I will give this movie credit for was the music choice. It was a nice bleed-in from Kong Skull Island's style, which I very much enjoyed. At the end of the day, it was nice to be back in the theatre watching a blockbuster with my friends. However, I went into this movie looking for a good time but still left empty-handed.

I have a hard time talking about this movie using coherent thoughts so here's this. The best parts about Paths of Glory are the cinematography and the writing. Each shot is perfectly composed and every monologue is clever and thought-provoking. The action is captured so well using whip pans and motion blur, it's a great style of filming hand-on-hand combat. The ending is the icing on the cake. it's just a great movie. The more I digest it the more I appreciate it. One of those movies I think everyone should see. Also, the acronym for this movie is pog.

I mean I guess it's fine, there's nothing inherently bad about it, it's just very uninteresting. The Noise got very annoying very fast and the action was very poorly directed/shot/edited. I haven't read the book this is based on, and after watching this I have no interest in doing so. I guess it's an interesting concept, it's just so poorly executed. I read somewhere that Charlie Kaufman was originally hired to write the script, which could've made this movie ten times better in my opinion. He's so good at writing the human psyche that I feel like his hand would do numbers for the script with writing The Noise. Movies that struggle to be released, whether that be distribution conflicts, constant reshoots, the nonstop switching of cast and crew, or all of the above never end up being good. Chaos Walking and The New Mutants being prime examples.

I had a weird binge of Live PD YouTube clips today which lead me to remember that this movie exists. The one big problem with this movie is the direction. The movie is set up to be a found footage type movie, yet it intermixes shots that wouldn't make sense given that context. Some scenes will switch between the found footage and having a clear cameraman which made it a little hard to follow. The shaky camera was a great way of presenting this story, so I'll give them that. It heightened the suspension and did a good job of masking the poor practical gore effects. Another poor choice was the editing towards the end. The loud music playing over the funeral was really distracting. Admittedly, I did well up at the end, but the music and then the flashback that followed took me out. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena is incredibly amusing, and I'd love to see more from them in the future. ","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2021-04-08

I think with so many other movies in the same vein, Event Horizon struggled to find an original storyline to follow. This left it as a swiss cheese version of what it could actually be. The gore is fun and Sam Neil was better than I expected.

I could go on all day about all the things wrong with this movie but it got me to full-on laugh a couple of times and that's all I really need to enjoy something like this. The rest of the ""jokes"" that didn't make me laugh fell incredibly flat and came off as forced or cringy. Speaking of forced, the attempt at lgbtq+ illusion was very forced and stuck out like a sore thumb. Before you start throwing any hands, watch, and you'll see exactly what I mean. Octavia Spencer and Bobby Cannavale are both way too good of actors to play roles like these. Jason Bateman is a good actor too but he played crab man way too well for me to want him to stay out of stuff like this. It's an enjoyable watch but the second you start looking at anything besides the jokes its faults become too apparent to ignore. Extra half star for crab man.

Besides the first Iron Man, the Avengers, and Black Panther, scores from the MCU are boring, bland, and could probably be found in the YouTube audio library under the ""adventure"" tag. As for things I didn't like, the Pym Particles are too flimsy of a plot device; the movie never clearly defines what all they can and cannot do so they're just used however they're needed to progress the story along. Another thing I wished this movie paid more attention to is physics. If the Pym Particle decreases the size and increases density, Scott would still weigh the same, right? This means he wouldn't be able to fly on an ant or stand on someone's gun, but maybe I'm being too critical. Overall, watching this movie during an MCU rewatch is like a breath of fresh air. It's so stylistically different and works as the perfect break from the standard MCU formula.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",2021-04-20

Ultron is such a fun villain, it's too bad he got stuck in such a mediocre movie. Maybe it's because I've seen this movie so many times or maybe it's because I finally saw it for how it truly was, but I really did not enjoy this rewatch as much as I have prior ones. The action was boring, everyone felt like the same character, and there are so many story points I hate (Nat and Bruce, Quicksilver, the over-sexualization of Nat, the lullaby, etc.). If this didn't have that dinner party scene where they all try to pick up the hammer then my rating would've been a lot worse.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",2021-04-21
2021-04-24,The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,2021,https://boxd.it/1Ow65t,3,,"69/100

The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was an, at times, lackluster continuation of its characters but leaves me in a spot where I'm wanting more. I hope we get more of John Walker and witty Bucky in the near future.

Episode One (3.5 Stars, 73/100)

Already, I like this better than Wandavision. The individual storylines for Bucky and Sam are both really strong. I love the look into Bucky's mental health and how he's still recovering from hydra's brainwashing. I like Sam's storyline because it's much more personal. I like that Marvel is using these shows to take a break from the action and explosions to tell smaller stories and ones that can hit a little closer to home. I think where this episode falls short is in the action. Physics doesn't really matter in this show and the choreography falls a bit short. Not to mention the editing, which was pretty weak as well. I'm excited to see where this show goes. It seems pretty grounded which is nice. Bucky is one of the better characters in the MCU just from a storytelling standpoint so I'm glad they're fully utilizing him here.

Episode Two (3.5 Stars, 71/100)

I keep seeing a ton of reviews bashing John Walker, but in all honesty, he might be my favorite character. He actually has depth as a character, his writing is decent, and Wyatt Russel is doing a stupendous job playing him. I got huge Homelander vibes from his performance which is 100% a great thing. I first noticed it last episode, and it still occurred in this episode, but the editing is really off. Fight scenes are confusing and even simple dialogue scenes are jarring and off-putting. I was disappointed to see that Sam did not continue his family storyline this episode as I loved it in the first one. I enjoy where the show is taking him now, but I hope they revisit that eventually. Another thing I like that they're exploring in the show is the cop stereotype. It was cool to see them go from hostile to fanboys after realizing who Sam was. This show is pretty decent, and I'm looking forward to episode 3.

Episode Three (3 Stars, 68/100)

Pretty lackluster in terms of story. I wasn't a huge fan of Zemo being royalty bc it felt so tacked on and was just an easy writing scapegoat for how the characters would get the equipment they needed. There were reports around summer of last year that they had to do reshoots due to a subplot revolving around a virus. That was pretty apparent here. A bunch of lines from different characters had different audio quality than the rest of the conversation, a lot of lines were delivered while faces were out of frame, etc. I'm sure they tried their best given the circumstances but the patch job was pretty messy and very noticeable in my opinion. Sharon's character did a full 180 since we last saw her and I'm curious where they're going with that. As of right now, she and John Walker are the only two characters I care about right now.

Episode Four (3.5 Stars, 72/100)

Love the direction they're taking John Walker. Everything else I could take or leave.

Episode Five (3.5 Stars, 76/100)

My favorite episode so far. I think this show is finally learning what to do with these characters. Very much looking forward to episode six

Episode Six (3 Stars, 62/100)

The story and action were poorly directed, every scene felt awkward and tense, and all of the performances felt a bit off. An unfortunate end for what episode 5 built up to be a great finale. I loved Sam's speech, but I couldn't take him seriously with that stupid new suit. I'm curious what the futures of the ""villain"" characters are, as it seems they're setting up some form of the Thunderbolts which sounds very entertaining. Love the party scene at the end. This new version of Bucky is such a fun character.","w/ myself, @ home, @ school, disney+",

Why does every space movie have a really suspenseful and dragged-out action scene where the characters are outside floating in space to fix a part of the ship that is broken that is only suspenseful because it takes place in space? Is that too picky of a nitpick? Probably. This movie is pretty stupid. There's nothing inherently bad about it, it's just uninteresting, boring, and just feels like a complete waste of time.

Much better than I remember. The CGI was shotty, the score was great yadda yadda. Klaue and Killmonger are great villains and it's a shame they were killed off so soon. Would've loved to see them come back in a future project. My one big problem is how much of a crutch vibranium is. They never specify what all it does so it just does everything. Heal a gunshot wound? Sure. Store kinetic energy? Sure. It's such a loose concept and comes off as lazy writing when they introduce a new use for it.","w/ myself, @ home, disney+",2021-04-28

The gunfight scenes are so well choreographed and shot; there were multiple instances that made me chuckle to myself in amazement.

Invincible definitely worked for me more than it didn't, but it still had some glaring issues. For starters, the pacing is terrible, there are some story beats that need repairs, and the animation is hit or miss. Either it's meticulously drawn frame by frame, or it's a still picture keyframed for a few seconds. When it gets good, the animation is really good, but when it gets bad, it just comes off as lazy. There's something so satisfying about seeing so much gore in superhero action. Pretty much every superhero movie is rated PG-13 which obviously doesn't allow for a lot of blood, so seeing Omni-man tear through people like they're nothing was so freakin fun. Pretty much every character is voiced by an A-lister, so it was really fun to click the screen every time a new character appeared to see whose voice it was. The music was great. The original score was nothing special but the song choice was on point, and I added a few to my >2000 playlist. I'll definitely come back for the second and third seasons.","w/ myself, @ home, prime",

James Wan is a master of suspense. Some of the scenes got so tense that I was scared for the camera to cut to the next shot. When the horror isn't using that tactic, it unfortunately comes off as cheesy and almost humorous. On top of that, apart form those suspense ridden scenes, the editing is pretty bad. For example, the weaving of the story between the Warrens and the Hodgsons felt a little choppy and ruined the pacing in the beginning. The big mystery of what Vera Farmiga saw during her vision during the first movie was just shrugged off as no big deal and was unclimatically revealed in this movie, which was kinda disappointing. The plot felt really overstuffed; a nun, the crooked man, and an old guy? Pick a struggle movie geez. I feel like the main story wasn't enough to make a whole movie on its own so they had to add those extra villains to make it more fascinating. Maybe just don't choose this case for a movie then? Idk. Speaking of the villians, the effects for the crooked man were a little jank but I can't tell if that was the point or not so I won't be too hard on it. It has flashy cinematography, sure, but its not enough to make me like it as much as its predecessor. It just feels so messy. I will watch the new one though!

It's.... certainly a movie. I knew before going into this that there would be a twist, but even knowing ahead of time didn't prepare me for what was to come. It's entertaining; I love the style and the balance between drama and comedy worked really well. A lot of the plot points were so insane that I had to laugh at them, but it wasn't too distracting that I missed the point they were trying to make. Great performances across the board and I loved hearing David Cross' voice, that was my favorite of the many surprises this film brought. ","w/ myself, @ school, hulu",2021-05-07

This is one dumbass movie. It feels like a cheap knock-off of The Conjuring, even though they have the same director and this was released 3 years earlier. So many of the scares feel cheesy and laughable. The score is notable, but only aids in making the scares feel ingenuine. The color palette is so dull and bland and when you know James Wan can do so much more (Aquaman) it's like drinking club soda when you know there's Orange Fanta in the back. It's just a dumb horror movie.","w/ myself, @ home, @ school, netflix",2021-05-07

I was disappointed with the ending until I heard that final line, but now I really like it. I think they should've explored a subplot with Ingrid's mother a little more. Maybe have Ingrid make her decisions based on lessons she learned from her mother in the past, and blame her psychotic behavior as an odd attempt to honor her death and make her proud. It also could've led to a better ending than we got. Aubrey Plaza was at her best here, I think this is exactly the kind of character she plays best; creepy and inadvertently hilarious. Elizabeth Olsen played the role of petty Instagram influencer really well, I think seeing the crack in character revealing she's actually a bitch was a nice portrayal of how people like that can actually be. I think if they delved more into that it could've turned into the classic ""never meet your heroes"" cliche so I'm glad they kept it brief. Another cliche I'm glad they dodged was the ""you weren't who I thought you were, but it's okay bc you're honest now."" Avoiding these story points made the movie feel more fresh and more fun to watch. Worth the watch.","w/ myself, @ school, hulu",2021-05-13

Imagine my surprise when the credits rolled and I saw that Steven Soderbergh directed this; makes the Ocean's 7-11 reference like 10x better. I feel like there were one or two scenes randomly missing from various parts of the movie. Like characters would jump from one location to the other with no explanation. I did like the classic ""double heist"" twist here. Heist movies are one of my favorite genres of film, and I 100% plan on directing my own one day should I be given the opportunity, but it is a little annoying that the only two endings to be found in a good heist movie are either that the robbery was unsuccessful or there was a secret twist to the heist that makes them ultimately successful in the end. Good watch, I hope Soderbergh comes back every couple of years to direct a caper.

Is Pixar back? Luca brings back so many of my favorite Pixar qualities that I feel like they just haven't been delivering on recently. The animation is beautiful; the water, the surface textures on some of the rocks and houses, the lighting, the skin, it's some of the best I've ever seen (keep in mind Pixar hand animates all of their movies). The character designs weren't very Pixar-esque, but I think that only aided in making the movie feel like something fresh for the studio. The story was a bit patchy in my opinion, I feel like Luca heading off to school wasn't a proper ending. His interest in school never really appeared until about 30 minutes in and wasn't brought up again until he's shipped off at the very end. Maybe his parents being more accepting of his shore visits or a stronger emphasis on the town accepting him would've been more appropriate. It's good! This is good. There are a lot of great moments and I certainly enjoyed my watch. That scene where Giulia's dad goes after Alberto almost got to me. Hard-then-soft dad characters always hit me hard! After being disappointed by Soul I wasn't too eager to see anything new from Pixar, but Luca has certainly turned those tables as I cant wait to see what they have in store next. Give us Cars 2 part 2, cowards!

Hail, Caesar! is my kind of movie. It constantly kept me on my toes with the constant genre switches and there was never a dull moment. The comedy was subtle but worked really well for me. I definitely owe this a rewatch, as I watched this in two parts with about a week in between and I was a little underwhelmed by the ending, I assume, as a result of it.","w/ myself, w/ kyle, w/rigg, w/ jack, on vacation, @ home, netflix",2021-07-09

Every character this movie has to offer is so loveable. Each one has their own quirks and characteristics that make the movie really entertaining. The Dude is such a loveable character in my opinion. Never have I seen someone so chill, yet so stressed out about everything at the same time. It reminds me of myself a bit, to be honest. This is my second Coen Brother movie in a row, and I am really beginning to like their style. ","w/ myself, in car, @ home, netflix",2021-07-10

This movie has so many things it tries to do but doesn't accomplish any of them. Is it a movie about civilians who get drafted into war? Kind of, but it's barely touched on. Is it a movie about a father's relationship with his son? Kind of, but the movie focuses much more on the father-daughter dynamic. Oh, is it a movie about a father's bond with his daughter? Kind of, but the movie focuses much more on killing monsters. Oh, so it's a movie about killing monsters? Kind of, but it doesn't do it all that well as a majority of the fights are just endless gunshots that eventually just dim out. All of the concepts are so half-baked that it makes the movie seem half-assed. It's a fun movie, don't get me wrong I certainly enjoyed my watch, it's just not very well done. Credit where credit is due, the White Spike's character design and a majority of the CGI was very well done.

2021-07-15,Loki,2021,https://boxd.it/1ZFRDf,3.5,,"71/100

Definitely my favorite of the D+ shows so far. Very excited for season two.

Episode One (3 Stars, 68/100)

I feel like every new Marvel TV show or movie gets messier and messier with their plot hole explanations. With Loki, it's explaining why we're only seeing the TVA now as well as all of that timeline mumbo jumbo. The first episode was enjoyable. A lot of fun stylistically and I love the colors and soundtrack. I was hoping the D.B. Cooper thing would be bigger than it actually was, so I was a little disappointed there. This show looks promising! I know that's what I said about the last two Disney+ Marvel shows which both ended up being a little disappointing but maybe this will be different? I'm cautiously optimistic.

Episode Two (3.5 Stars, 75/100)

I feel like this show is really starting to find its stride, this episode rocks. The whole roxxcart scene was done really well, some of my favorite of the Marvel stuff we've gotten on Disney+ so far. I think the song choice in the open was a little off but maybe it's setting up something later so I won't be too harsh on it yet. I think the less you think about how the TVA operates the more the show makes sense.

Episode Three (3 Stars, 60/100)

I feel like it was unfair watching this episode after last weeks considering how good that one was and how mundane this one was but I don't know any other way to watch these other than chronological order so here we are. There were a lot of story points that seemed useless and the fact that it ended in a cliffhanger meaning there will be more of this next week does not excite me in the least. Very boring. Cool colors.

Episode Four (3.5 Stars, 72/100)

A lot of fun. They already said Loki was bisexual, it would've been cool to see him pursue a man imo.

Episode Five (3.5 Stars, 77/100)

My favorite episode yet. I felt like Mobius' goodbye and old Loki's death were a little rushed and awkward. Had tons of fun picking out all of the easter eggs.

Episode Six (3.5 Stars, 76/100)

A bit exposition-heavy but a ton of fun. Kang was a fun, yet expected, reveal. Definitely my favorite of the D+ shows so far, and I'm glad we're getting a season two.","w/ myself, @ home, on vacation, disney+",
2021-07-15,Black Widow,2021,https://boxd.it/1ZGEz7,3,,"68/100

This movie takes place in the MCU, a world filled with aliens and infinity stones and time travel, yet Black Widow still manages to jump the shark. You mean to tell me that two people can break an ex-superhero out of a Russian super-prison only using an iPad and a helicopter, but can't locate a giant floating base hiding in the clouds? Maybe it's just me, but that seems a little inconsistent. There were a couple of other story bits that felt a little awkward to me too, like the mask and wig switcheroo in the final act and Taskmaster as a whole. Speaking of Taskmaster, she had barely any screen time considering she was supposed to be the ""big bad"" of the movie. The only cool scene of hers was the fight on the bridge in the first act. Her fight style was so rigid and calculated and it made me really excited to see more. However, as the movie went on, her presence began to feel more and more forced. Take the fight with Red Guardian for example. It added nothing to the story and only felt like it was there to give Taskmaster more screen time. It's a cool concept for a character and I hope she's utilized in another project down the line. At the end of the day, Black Widow is a fine movie. The direction was slick and felt fresh considering the MCU's current palate, but besides that, brought nothing too exciting to the table. Endgame gave a nice send-off to Black Widow as a character, so seeing more of her here, without giving much more closure, felt like beating a dead horse. Marvel has four movies a year slated for the next couple of years, and after seeing this, I'm a little worried they're going to start choosing quantity over quality.

As a side note, I always see the new Marvel movies with my dad, and it was really nice to have a chance to do that for the first time in almost 2 years. I head off to college soon and won't be able to continue that tradition, so I really enjoyed my theatre experience for that reason.

I definitely owe this a rewatch, as I was constantly three steps behind whatever the movie was currently showing. I like how the Coen Brothers included two characters who’s only purposes are to explain what’s currently going on to the audience; even they knew the plot was a little convoluted. I think my only problem lies with the ending; it felt rushed and offered little closure for most of the characters. The characters and premise alone make <i>Burn After Reading </i>a very fun watch.

Cruella was a pleasant surprise! This movie is a ton of fun. 

The soundtrack is great, both in the music selection and the original composition. Some of the songs featured wouldn't have been released yet during the time period the movie is set, and while that does usually annoy me (take Gatsby for example) I am willing to excuse it because the selection is just that good. 

There were a few points throughout the movie where I thought the plot would go one way and didn't, so it was nice to be kept on my toes. 

I think a couple of parts from Cruella's various plans were a little far-fetched and didn't really work for me, but they usually resulted in a really fun action scene so again, I'm willing to excuse it. 

I went into this expecting to watch another Lion King or Mulan, so you can imagine my surprise when I walked out having thoroughly enjoyed my time. I'm curious how well this works leading into 101 Dalmations, considering she's the protagonist of this movie and the antagonist of that one.","w/ maris, @ theatre",2021-07-29

I found myself much more bored with this movie than on prior rewatches. The plot is way too overstuffed, but to be honest, there's nothing they could have done about that considering how many characters are in this thing. I was considering a 3.5 until the very end, Thanos sitting in his garden as he grins to the crescendoing music is such a perfect moment. Gives me chills every time.

I'm glad Peacemaker is getting a spinoff, he was definitely my favorite character, and I'm excited to see more of him in the future.

This dystopian future won’t be dystopian.

Anyway, I love this. The music choices are just so good, and the concept of a robot learning how to love from watching 60s musical tapes is just so perfect and fun.

I know this style of humor doesn’t appeal to kids as well as slapstick or potty humor does, but it certainly appeals to me. Something about Megamind and Metro Man going back and fourth about microwave warranties has me giggling just thinking about it.

Looper is a very interesting concept that was, unfortunately, very poorly executed. The story takes way too long to find its footing, and even when it does, the editing is dogshit so everything seems jumbled and convoluted. It was a really odd choice to digitally change JGL's face to look more like Bruce Willis. I would've rathered an ""inaccurate look"" than the green-eyed uncanny valley monster we got. On another note, the child acting is crazy good, and I'm surprised that kid hasn't seen more of a career in the 9 years since this movie has been released.

After actually watching it, I can gladly say it seems I have missed a bullet.  I cannot stand Barry Ackroyd's cinematography. It has hurt a lot of otherwise good movies, and it certainly didn't help this one. The twist is so stupid and makes no sense once it's revealed. I actually knew about it going in and convinced myself it was a fake spoiler because everything leading up to it proved it to be false. Not to mention Jason Momoa's character is extremely unlikeable and had me rooting for ""the bad guys"" the whole time. I'm from Pittsburgh, so it was cool to see a lot of familiar locations, but all it did was make me go like <a href=""https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/maxresdefault-1605111824.jpg?crop=0.782xw:0.695xh;0.218xw,0.0826xh&resize=1200:*"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> for a majority of the movie. At the end of the day, Isabella Merced is still my celebrity crush (apart from Jake Gyllenhaal), and I was still happy to watch this and see her. Sweet Girl dragged on much longer than it should have, and the fact that they set it up for a sequel instead of actually giving the movie a solid ending is just as lazy as it is annoying.

On a more personal note, this is the first movie I watched at college! I'm all moved in and studying film production so I'm excited to see where that takes me.

If The Lego Movie is one of my all-time favorite movies, and both TLM and Free Guy share similar plots, then why wasn't Free Guy as good? I think Free Guy's story was much weaker.

He's charismatic, he's funny, and he's one of my favorite people in the business right now. Unfortunately, I think this is why I disliked him as a villain. He's been a great actor in everything I've seen him in, but I just don't think the villain role is what he was meant to play. Speaking of roles people were meant to play, I feel like Ryan Reynolds just plays himself in every movie now. Obviously, this works for him, as every male teenager under the sun has a man-crush on him, but it's starting to get old. Also, I doubt Free Guy got the idea to use Joey Scarburry's Believe It or Not from my debut short film, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8xWEONXzps"" rel=""nofollow"">Believe It</a>, but I'm not totally ruling it out either. Free Guy was better than I expected, but that's not saying much considering I was expecting complete horse shit.

I loved this movie as a kid. I think the fantastical elements and cool gadgets that amazed me as a kid come off as jumping the shark for me now.

It was interesting to see just how seriously everyone would take Bianca, especially Lars. I think my favorite scenes were the ones that only included Lars and Bianca, I loved seeing how real Bianca was to Lars; Gosling was at his best here. I really liked how even the thing Lars created to be immortal came to an end. Bianca's ""passing"" was quite bittersweet for Lars, as it allowed him to not fear love again but it was also a painful reminder of what death feels like.

I was very tempted to give this four stars. There were a few story beats that I wasn’t totally on board with but besides that, it was a really good watch. The performances were great, I loved the cinematography, the opening credits were very unsettling, and it actually delivered some good scares. Candyman’s trypophobia inducing make-up in the finale was unfavorable but besides that, the third act was the stand-out feature. I loved the ending; I thought it was going one way but went another and enjoyed it thoroughly. I feel like the reputation the horror genre has built for itself recently is that horror movies can be so much more than just cheap thrashers, and I’m happy <i>Candyman</i> furthers that stereotype. 


Movie aside, this had to be the strangest theatre experience I’ve ever had. The whole theatre smelled like boof and there were multiple families with children that couldn’t be over the age of five. The child behind me in particular kept laughing anytime something violent happened. Very odd.

Plus, it has Jason Bateman, and as an avid fan of Arrested Development and Smartless, I figured why not. There was one scene that got a chuckle out of me but besides that, this was a pain to get through. This movie felt like so many things crammed into one. Is it a road trip movie? A buddy cop? And why were the last 30 minutes necessary? The ending sucked and Mellissa McCarthy is just not a good comedic actor. She's good in serious roles; that one scene at the restaurant was really good, so it's too bad she only gets cast in comedies. I don't know, maybe I'm just mad I wasted my time.

After reading a bunch of reviews, it seems the common consensus is that people who haven't seen the original love this one, and those who have seen the original, don't like this one. I fall into the ladder. I watched the original Danish version about a week ago with my dad and this remake just doesn't do enough new things for me to enjoy my watch. Seeing as it's a near carbon copy, and the things that they did change I didn't like, I had a hard time getting through it. At the end of the day, I persevered for my man Jake, but I wasn't exactly happy about it. 

As for the things I didn't like compared to the original (FEATURES SPOILERS FOR BOTH THE DANISH AND AMERICAN VERSIONS):

- They took the camera outside of the operator's room. even though they only did it once, part of the magic of the original was getting to picture the people on the other end of the phone for yourself.
- They kept the baby alive. I think enough of a hopeful ending was created from Emily being kept alive, and keeping the baby alive too ruined some of the horror.
- They included more info about the results of Jake's trials over the credits. I liked the ambiguous ending of the original. 
- Jake had a much more anger-driven performance. I am a huge Jake Gyllenhaal fan, and as much as I enjoyed his performance, I think I enjoyed the more subtle angry that was displayed in the Danish version.

Things I did like compared to the original:

- Opening with that Bible verse was a cool idea. Matched the plot pretty well.
- Jake's inhaler. I liked the opening in the bathroom, I wish he would have used the inhaler more so it didn't feel like as much of a one-off thing.
- The casting. Everyone did a fine job and I enjoyed the little easter eggs of Bill Burr and Paul Dano as some of the callers. While watching an interview I learned that they actually had the actors on the other end call in live and act. Thought that was pretty cool.
- Jake's performance in the bathroom scene at the end was great. Seeing him break down at the thought of not seeing his daughter for a while felt so real. I liked the more ambiguous ending of the original, but this wasn't a bad scene.

I'm sure more will come to me as I process it more. It's not a bad movie. Those who are unfamiliar with the original seemed to have got the same reaction out of this one as I did the original. I still am not a huge fan of remaking a movie just because it's not in English, but at the end of the day, this wasn't all that bad. I think I just can't feel comfortable with giving it a very high rating due to its originality compared to the original, and even where it did differentiate, it wasn't for good reasons. Only four more months until the next Jake movie❤️

The cinematography is stunning and the colors are just the same. A lot of the imagery with the ""frame within a frame"" reminded me of The Graduate, which coincidentally is also about a rather taboo relationship. I'd like to watch this again, now that I have a sense of what the story is, so I can focus more on the visuals and less on the subtitles; the one flaw in foreign films in my opinion is that it's hard to soak in both during the same view.

I wasn’t a huge fan of how it was wrapped up and I’m really tired of the cliche where the main character meets the love interest under some sort of lie and when he decides to tell the truth she gets mad. This wasn’t the first time I’d seen it but I hope it’s the last. 

I love the way this movie looks. The 70s aesthetic (the colors, cars, and style, not the racism) is so visually satisfying and probably part of the reason I liked this movie so much. 

Not a single performance missed. Everyone bodies their roles. 

Very powerful message, it’s been told a lot, but arguably not as well as it was here. Including the clips at the end was especially impactful. 

One thing I wanted to point out was how Adam Driver’s character purposefully missed shooting John David Washington’s character’s car after he threw the brick through the window, but then in the next scene showed off his sharp shooting skills at the shooting range. My dad and I both pointed that out to each other in the moment and were surprised that it didn’t come back to bite him later on. 
 
Great watch. My friend Will has been trying to get me to watch this for a few months now, but it wasn’t until I was perusing letterboxd during Spanish class (as I do) and while looking at this film's page the kid next to me leaned over and said “I hate that movie.

I’m honestly ashamed to say it, but the recent news revealing Gary Francis Poste (never trust a man with 3 names) as being the Zodiac Killer honestly took a little bit of value out of this movie. 

I know that a majority of this movie was fabricated by Fincher in order to make the story a little more neat and easier to digest, but the whole movie I couldn’t help but have that Gary fucker floating around in the back of my head. 

Even though I knew a majority of the plot points were fiction, the movie providing an answer to one of, if not the biggest unsolved case of the last century was part of the charm and what made it enjoyable. 

I’m still gonna say this is my favorite movie, but that’s only because my second favorites are Baby Driver and Whiplash and I don’t want to seem like a film bro lmao. 

So, in conclusion, fuck you Gary Francis Poste, not only for murdering all of those people but for ruining the magic of Zodiac for me.

I'm seeing No TIme to Die on Friday and wanted to refresh myself on all of the Daniel Craig Bond movies before I go so marathon incoming.

I watched this movie over the span of a couple of days so it is kind of hard for me to pinpoint what exactly I liked, but I know that I liked it.

I thought that the scene where they play casino royale scene was really choppy in the way that it was written. I'm sure hour-long breaks are common for the actual game but Bond going back and forth between playing cards and beating some guys up/ nearly dying from poisoning felt all over the place. 

The story making sense depends too much on little details and lines which is very annoying to me. If I stop paying attention for even a second I feel like I'm miles behind. This left for a few things in the finale not making total sense to me.

Fine movie. I'm curious how the others rank compared to this one, but considering they don't have a cock and ball torture scene with Mads Mikkelson, I doubt they're all that good.","w/ myself, @ home, @ mu, sparrow, prime",2021-10-18

This time I watched it with my Dad, and it was a huge joy to see him experience some of the plot twists for the first time. I always say Brad Pitt's death was the biggest jaw-dropping moment I've ever seen and I was glad to see him agree.

This movie is so fun. I have huge respect towards a director (or directors) that can pull off a good movie in only 90 minutes. The pace is incredibly fast, and every line is crucial to the story. Every performance is so fun and quirky and I could watch each one of these characters endlessly.

2021-10-20,Spider-Man: Homecoming,2017,https://boxd.it/2dILT9,4,Yes,"83/100

I feel like Marvel Studio's version of Spider-Man just isn't Spider-Man. I don't like how reliant Peter is on Karen and all of the gadgets that come with the Stark suit are make it too easy on him; face recognition, different types of webs, etc. We barely got any web-slinging, and the one chance we did have at getting some was replaced by a three-minute Audi ad.

For the stuff I did like, I love Michael Keaton's Vulture. I often wonder what John Malkovich's version of the character would have looked like and I hope that maybe we could see some form of his character someday.

The twist with Vulture being Liz's dad is still one that holds up to this day, that scene between him and Peter in the car is one of my favorites from the MCU. 

The whole third act is great. I think a majority of that is due to Peter not having Stark's gadgets to aid him and learning to use his own skills to beat the villain. Too bad that's ditched for the next two movies and the first two acts of the sequel, only to have him learn the same lesson at the end of the next one.

Spider-Man: Homecoming is one of my favorites of the MCU, I just wish Jon Watts had a better understanding of the character.

Alfonso Cuaron's version of Harry Potter is a huge change of pace from what Chris Columbus gave us, almost to the point where it feels like a soft reboot. Hogwarts changed layout, characters changed design, characters are much more prone to joking, the color palette is different, etc. These are more observations than they are critiques, but I think I prefer Columbus' ambiance over Cuaron's. 

I like the form of time travel used here. I'm always fascinated by the different interpretations of time travel in movies and having there be one singular timeline where everything is destined to happen is a really fun concept to me.

As a side note, Hermoine laughs really weird in those winter scenes.

2021-10-22,Quantum of Solace,2008,https://boxd.it/2dWjDv,3,Yes,"I think I misunderstood what a Bond movie is. I went into this franchise expecting something similar to Mission Impossible; simple action movie plots that you can just turn your brain off to watch. James Bond turned out to be the opposite; intricately woven characters and the plot depends on every line so that if you look away for even a minute you are completely lost the entire movie. Maybe this is my fault and these movies are amazing, but in my opinion, it's just not what I'm looking for from an action movie.

On another note, the editing is nauseating. There were so many quick cuts that I could hardly understand what was going on during action scenes. This, paired with the complicated plot, left me feeling lost for a majority of the movie.

Casino Royale did not have these problems as severely as Quantum of Solace did, so hopefully this is fixed in future installments. ","w/ myself, @ home, prime",2021-10-21
2021-10-22,Skyfall,2012,https://boxd.it/2dXMbx,4.5,Yes,"This movie is fucking beautiful, god bless you, Roger Deakins.

Skyfall has everything Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were missing, I think this is the closest I've seen to a perfect bond movie.

The action is at its best here, the opening train sequence being the stand-out feature.

Javier Bardem is the perfect Bond villain, he's creepy, he powerful, he's smart and he's gay. What more could you ever want?

I think Craig has really found what his version of the character is supposed to look like. The prior two installments feature him as a very deadpan stone-cold bitch, but here he's charming, charismatic, and what James Bond should be.

Also, as a side note, Skyfall has my favorite of the opening title sequences thus far.

I love this movie.","w/ myself, @ home, hulu",2021-10-21
2021-10-22,Spectre,2015,https://boxd.it/2e0VsX,2.5,Yes,"Man, this movie is disappointing. Skyfall was so incredibly good; I was hoping that with the same director Spectre would end up at least kind of decent but boy was I wrong.

I'm gonna say it. Christoph Waltz sucked. I know he can play evil and menacing; he was amazing in the opening of Inglorious Basterds, so why did he suck here? He seemed so frail and awkward. Skyfall featured Javier Bardem, the perfect bond villain, who plotted out his plan down to the very minute, and Waltz is supposed to be the mastermind to all of it? I don't know, I see what they were going for with casting Waltz but he seems so weak in comparison to the villains in the past who he is supposed to be more powerful than.

There were a bunch of plot points that I just couldn't get on board with. I get that Bond is supposed to be this chick magnet but fucking a recently widowed woman seems a bit overboard, especially when he's the reason she's a widow. Similarly, he all too quickly falls in love with the daughter of a man who betrayed him and corrupted his organization and then leaves said organization to pursue a life with her. I am in no position to be giving dating advice but from a film perspective, the whole point of these women is to be cycled through like a spinning revolver so it's a little unsatisfying to see Bond settle down.

Another plot point is how stupid Smart Blood is. I have a common rule of thumb with action movies that as soon as they mention the phrase ""nano tech"" I instantly grow a disliking for the movie because that is a cliche that is so overdone and is only used to make writing the story easier. It is stupid and I hate it.

I also hated the airplane chase scene. It seemed a little too far-fetched, even for Bond's standards. Felt lazy and took me out of the movie.

One final critique was how Waltz's character literally printed out pictures of people from his past to plaster on the walls of the old MI6 headquarters. It is a very minor story detail but it is laughable how stupid that is.

On a positive note, the opening oner was pretty fun. The helicopter fight was stupid but at least the movie started out on a good note.

I was debating whether Specter is deserving of a 2 and a 1/2 or a 3 and considering I watched the first half before I ate dinner and really liked it and then finished the second half after dinner and hated it, leaving the part that I hated to be fresher in my mind, I was going to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a 3. However, now that I've written my review and ran over a bunch of things in my head, I think I have decided that this movie is deserving of a 2 and a 1/2 like I originally thought. Not only is it a shit movie in general, but it is such a disappointment coming off of Skyfall. I'm seeing No Time to Die this weekend and I am very excited, to say the least. Hopefully, it's a better ending than what this gave us.","w/dad, w/mom, @ home, prime",2021-10-21
2021-10-24,LEGO Star Wars Terrifying Tales,2021,https://boxd.it/2edNt5,,,wasn't even that scary,"w/ myself, @ home, disney+",
2021-10-24,Dune,2021,https://boxd.it/2ee0B7,3,,"With each new delay, this movie only seemed to be hyped up more and more; I even saw someone go as far as to say that Dune would be the Star Wars of our generation. While I argue that Star Wars is the Star Wars of our generation, I understand where they're coming from. This movie is huge in its scope. The cast is a laundry list of A-listers, the set pieces are massive; everything about this movie is huge. 

However, I feel like this scale damages the movie more than benefits it. With so many wide shots and huge action pieces, it was hard to be invested in the characters. Maybe this is due to there being a second part and not all of the character development has been completed yet, but I felt no emotional attachment to any of the characters I saw on screen. There were a few emotional beats here or there, but not nearly enough of the characters were built up enough for me to care about them.

As for the action pieces... they were pretty underwhelming too. You can find big explosions in any action movie these days so they didn't come across as anything special. The blue/red shields that everything had were cool in concept but poor in execution. They were very inconsistent with their mechanics and were overwhelming visually.

On the other hand, there were a few things I did like. Stellan Skarsgard as Harkonnen made for a very visually intriguing villain. All of the little evil ceremonies he took part in were very fun to see. I wish we saw more of him. Timothee Chalamet as Paul, the one character they did actually flush out, was a stand-out feature. There weren't a ton of huge emotional beats where he could show off his range, but he did a great job with what he was given.

The action sequences with the sandworm were entertaining, hopefully, we get more of them in the second part.

Which, speaking of, are we even going to get? If this movie underperforms, considering its pandemic release date and dual release method, I wouldn't be surprised if it did. If a second part never comes, then this movie is kind of pointless. It's literally one-half of a movie if nothing comes after this.

I definitely want to watch this again, a part of me is scared I missed something and it is actually the masterpiece I've seen everyone makes it out to be, but until then, consider me underwhelmed.","w/dad, @ home, hbomax",2021-10-22
2021-10-25,No Time to Die,2021,https://boxd.it/2eyMmf,3.5,,"Cary Joji Fukunaga’s No Time to Die is the perfect bookend to the Daniel Craig James Bond era. I wouldn’t have labeled myself as a fan of the James Bond character before seeing No Time to Die, but despite that, I was still interested in seeing the new release. I rewatched all of the prior Daniel Graig installments in preparation, and I’m glad I did. I was instantly made aware as to why this franchise had such a following, and No Time to Die only fueled my newfound love for the films. The film not only served as a proper end to Daniel Craig’s take on the character, but it was also just a high-octane thriller that is just as exhilarating as it is poignant. If you’re a fan of action movies, the Daniel Craig James Bond movies, or any of the James Bond movies for that matter, you’re going to love No Time to Die.

Stepping out of the theater, I was a little overwhelmed. With a runtime of over two and a half hours, there was a lot to unpack. I can confidently say that rewatching all of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies prior to your viewing is the best way to go into this movie. The plot of each movie heavily references the ones before it and the people who accompanied me to the theater who hadn't seen the prior four found themselves lost.

I can tell that director Cary Joji Fukunaga was clearly a fan of some of the older Bond movies. The main villain of No Time to Die, Safin, owns an elaborate secret base set on a private island and employs a bunch of henchmen that wear matching clothes. I originally criticized the film for being too cartoony, but I soon realized that these features make the film very reminiscent of two of the more iconic James Bond films Dr. No (1962) and You Only Live Twice (1967), starring Sean Connery. 

Furthermore, a majority of the characters in No Time to Die are prone to quippy one-liners, one of the more iconic and memorable features found in the Connery era of James Bond. These features were a ton of fun looking back but did admittedly feel a little out of place considering none of the other Daniel Craig movies used these tropes.

After looking through others’ reviews of No Time to Die, my biggest complaint of the movie seems to be a common one; not enough Ana De Armas. Her character, Paloma, was a charming and entertaining way to kick off the movie and was easily my favorite character apart from Bond. I would have loved to see her stick around as a main character throughout the film, rather than just the 10 minutes she got. Her absence was a letdown, but considering this is my biggest critique of the movie, I’m very happy with what we got.

Felix Leiter, a repeating character from throughout the franchise, had a total shift in tone for this movie. In the prior Daniel Craig Bond films, he was a side character who was mainly business-oriented. However, in No Time to Die, he is very goofy and is out of nowhere Bond's best friend. Despite that, I enjoyed seeing this side of Felix, and these changes were very much welcome. In my opinion, it finally felt like Felix’s character was done justice, and if it weren’t for these changes, I don’t think his death would have hit me as hard as it did.

Speaking of M, most of the side characters were well utilized. M was his usual business self, which worked for me all but once, Moneypenny had a fun line about shooting Bond, and Q came out as gay which was a nice way to show inclusion without feeling too forced. The one time M’s sternness didn’t work for me was during the scene where he and Bond reflect on their progress outside by The River Thames. It was by no means a comedic moment, but I started laughing to myself in the theater because of how amusing two grown men dressed in suits trying to look serious while discussing something called ""Smart Blood"" looked. Both Daniel Craig and Ralph Fiennes gave a good performance during this scene, but I think the writing was too childish for me to be able to take them seriously.

Lyutsifer Safin, Rami Malek’s villain character, worked well for me too. Having Safin be the man that invaded Madeline Swann’s house as a child, a backstory that was given one movie prior in Spectre (2015), was not only a neat tie-in to a prior installment but also just worked really well from a plot standpoint. However, Safin as a character began to crumble as the movie continued. There is a scene in the third act where Bond's daughter bites Safin's finger and Safin just lets her run away. It didn’t make sense for Safin to do this, as he was, up until this point, shown to be ruthless towards all things James Bond, so it just came off as lazy writing. Safin was by no means my favorite Bond villain (looking at you Javiar Bardem), but I do like that he got his revenge on Madeline by killing Bond. Bond’s death gave Safin a happier ending than he did which was an odd choice but not one that I entirely disagree with.

Speaking of, I love Daniel Craig's Bond, he really is the perfect cast. He can play the stern and intimidating, but switch it up to playful and flirtatious at the flip of a switch. I felt like his character changed a little bit with each movie, but at least he ended on a high note. I'm still a little unsure how I feel about the nature of his death, but despite that, it still hit me like a ton of bricks. It is probably the most emotional I've gotten in a movie theater since Tony Stark's demise. My only issue is how long those missiles took to reach the island. There were at least 10 minutes of movie between the launch and the impact, giving Bond plenty of time to die which is funny considering the title.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, Lashana Lynch's character, the new 007, was my least favorite character in the movie. This is by no means a critique of the film as a whole, as that was the purpose of her character and Lynch did an amazing job making me feel the resentment the characters actually in the movie felt for her. Maybe I’ve gotten protective of Daniel Craig playing 007, but seeing her take the mantel was as equally frustrating as it was unsatisfying. There were some rumors going around recently that the franchise would move forward with her character, and while I do think very highly of her performance, I don't know how much longer I could tolerate her.

I liked the story. It wasn't perfect, for example killing off Spectre and Blofield, the big overarching villains from the entire franchise so unceremoniously was frustrating, but besides that, it was all pretty decent. I wish the main disease used in the movie didn't parallel so much with COVID, but obviously, they filmed the movie before the Pandemic so I won't be too harsh about that. It is interesting how that happened to line up, and that the studio decided to keep it in, however. I know that parallels to COVID have scared movie studios in the past, for example, Locked Down (2021) a movie about a heist that takes place during COVID performed poorly at the box office presumably because people wanted to escape from the virus, not consume more content about it. Marvel Studios’ The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021) had a subplot involving a viral disease but more than half the series was reshot to work around it. I respect No Time to Die for not trying to rush and change the plot last minute, as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier didn’t exactly turn out amazing, but parallels or not I just wish they hadn't included the prefix ""nano-"" in the virus description. It’s such a cliche name for a MacGuffin and felt very out of place here.

On the post-production side of things, I really liked the sound design. The deafening effect on Bond after the explosion at Vesper's grave was very well done and was a refreshing take on that concept. I'm very used to the ""loud ringing fade to silence"" trope that is used far too often. Another stand-out point for the sound design was during the dinner scene with Ana De Armas. The stereo and filter used with the walkie-talkie audio was a cool feature as well.

In the end, No Time to Die was a fitting end to the Craig era. Moving forward, I am excited to both go back and rewatch the old ones, as well as see who Eon has in store for us next. If you have followed the Daniel Craig movies thus far, and enjoy movies like the Mission: Impossible franchise or the Jason Bourne franchise, this movie is a must-see. It’s an amazing action movie even on its own, I just suggest you watch it with someone who’s a little more knowledgeable on the franchise so you’re not completely lost.","w/ will, @ theatre, cinemablography, w/ john, w/ zayd, w/ ben",2021-10-23
2021-10-27,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,2005,https://boxd.it/2ePqSn,3,Yes,"Not sure about this one. The dialogue was awkward, the cinematography was awkward, the direction was awkward; it all just felt off. The conflict between Harry and Ron kind of just simmered out without any resolution and Cho Chang and Harry's relationship was just left up in the air. Something odd I noticed was how many sexual jokes were made in this movie. It's not a complaint, just something to point out. I will say though, some of the performances from the side characters were some of the best I've seen in the franchise so far; Brendan Gleeson and David Tennant were both fantastic. A surprisingly great performance also came from whoever played Cedric Diggory's father, I teared up during that scene he finds Cedric dead and I owe it to him. Not a bad film by any means, it's surely a fun watch, but it just wasn't the Harry Potter I've grown to love.","w/ myself, @ mu, hbomax",2021-10-26

Order of the Phoenix feels like the sequel to Prisoner of Azkaban in terms of style and tone. I love the opening scene; it's very well shot and is very entertaining. The pacing in the middle feels a little off, more so than the other movies. Delores Umbridge is one of my favorite movie villains of all time. She was depicted perfectly and truly is evil. The final battle is beautiful in terms of visuals, but the direction felt a little off.

But, when you go into this movie expecting all of those things, you can't help but enjoy yourself.

Kind of shitty of the studio to recast Lavender Bloom from a black actor to a white actor the second the character actually has lines but that's really my only complaint. Lots of great stuff here. This was probably the movie I remembered the least of going into it so a lot of the twists and turns got genuine reactions out of me.

2021-11-03,The Conversation,1974,https://boxd.it/2g2o83,4.5,,"Yeah so this movie fucking slaps. The way that The Conversation has been pitched to me is that it's a slow-burn thriller, but there is nothing slow about this movie. Every scene offers a new twist and a new insight into Harry's character and I easily could have watched it for another hour. 

I think Harry might be one of the more intricate and more interesting characters I've seen put to screen. Gene Hackman does an outstanding job playing him and it's a role I feel he deserves more credit for. The amount of range needed to play Harry is unheard of. The way that Hackman plays all of Harry's little quirks and behavioral phenomena are so perfect (especially towards the end), and he never does too much or too little, always eating from Goldilock's porridge. 

All of the other characters are memorable and quirky in their own little ways which is something I think I take for granted in a lot of movies. It's sad how many characters in modern-day cinema lack actual character. 

There is a lot of great symbolism both in the set design and the cinematography, but I think the best feature from a production standpoint is the sound design. It makes sense for a movie about sound to have good sound quality, but I was still thoroughly surprised. The opening shot features some great sound design as multiple groups of people walk past the camera, and the static sound effect that they chose is so unique and memorable. During the final scene with Harry in the hotel, the score offers this horror-Esque orchestral riff which was more unsettling than most horror movie scores that I have seen.

The Conversation has a lot of depth, which makes me very excited to rewatch it. Films similar to this in that way (Parasite, Whiplash, etc.) only get better upon rewatch so I'm eager to watch it again.

Two final things I want to leave you all with are one, this is my 1200 unique film logged on Letterboxd, and two, The Conversation was actually nominated for best picture at the Oscars in 1975 but lost. However, The Conversation lost to The Godfather Part II, the other Francis Ford Coppola film from that year, and Coppola was mad about it! Good stuff.

The music that was chosen felt like JC Penny background music, with something a little more mainstream, the soundtrack would have enhanced the movie significantly. The editing and cinematography was boring, again with a little more style this movie could have been made much better.

One minor nitpick I have is how poorly the setting was established. I didn't realize it took place in the 90s until they mentioned the invention of viagra. 

Something else I didn't like was how Maggie had Parkinsons. It was an interesting choice, but I feel like it messed with the tone. Apart from that, this movie was bright and witty and fast paced, I feel like cutting it from the story would make the movie feel a little more neat. Obviously this cuts the main conflict from the storyline, but I feel like accentuating Jamie's need for female attraction, and writing the story around him learning to settle down and fall in love would be much more fitting. 

One last note, I usually hate Josh Gad but loved him here. He's not a half bad actor, I think Hollywood needs to give him more straight roles or needs to be working with better directors. He feels the same in every other movie I've seen him in; I think a little more variation would do him good.","w/ myself, @ mu, sparrow, bff",2021-11-18

The beautiful winter landscapes, the rushing water, the wooden forts, the blazing fire, the bloody carcasses, the brutal injuries, the grizzly wildlife, etc. This movie was two hours and a half long, and I could have watched it for much much longer.

I feel like The Revenant improves the more I sit on it. The more I soak it in, the more enjoyable it became. I definitely want to rewatch this soon.

If you get the chance, watch this with your dad. Mine was infatuated with the wilderness and survival techniques, as well as audibly disgusted by the bear scene. Watching it with him made this movie a lot better.

I can't imagine what it was like to film this. The harsh conditions that Hugh went through were also endured by the entire crew. It's truly a filmmaking marvel.

2021-11-27,Red Notice,2021,https://boxd.it/2jHvIr,2.5,,"The twist was so unneeded and made for an extremely unsatisfying ending. The characters do not change from the beginning to the end of the movie which made the whole thing feel like a massive waste of time. Of course, this was set up for a sequel because what movie isn't these days, and if Netflix thinks for one second that I'm going to watch it they'd have to be out of their minds.

It's annoying how often studios will sink $200 million into a movie that does absolutely nothing new and is almost always poorly reviewed. How about instead of making another Dwayne Johnson buddy cop movie, Netlfix takes the $200 million and gives ten lesser-known directors $20 million to make something unique? Netflix has a power that not a lot of other studios have, they can take risks on smaller projects like these, so why don't they do it? The ""blockbuster"" is slowly becoming the same movie, and I'm sick and tired of it.

On the positive side, I enjoyed some of the adventure aspects, and while the Indiana Jones reference was a little on the nose, it was appreciated. Ryan Reynold's quips landed pretty much every time and were my sole source of entertainment for most scenes.

One last thing I want to note is that there was nothing apart from the Vin Diesel joke in the final scene that was stopping this from being a Fast and Furious spin-off. All three main actors are playing the exact same characters they play in the FF franchise, with a few name changes this would fit right in.

2021-11-29,Eternals,2021,https://boxd.it/2k2mNz,3,,"I watched Eternals over a day and a half ago and I am still having trouble making up my mind. Right off the bat, I don't think this deserves all of the hate that it has been getting. It's bad, but it's not that bad. There were a few aspects here and there that I enjoyed.

For the things I didn't like, the plot was way too overstuffed. I had a hard time trying to figure out where the movie was going because it seemed like each act had a different villain. I feel like a whole trilogy of movies was stuffed into one. Was the main villain The Deviants? Ikaris? Kro? Arishem? Thena? Each one of them was being set up to be the villain at one point and I still don't know looking back which one was supposed to be the biggest threat.

Speaking of Thena, what was the point of introducing her 'memory overload' if it had absolutely no effect on the plot whatsoever? That was like 10 minutes of screentime that could have easily been cut. Or, on the flip side, cut out all of the other villains and make Thena the big baddie. It was an interesting storyline when it was first introduced but it ended up going nowhere and seemed like a waste of time. A similar thing occurred when they showed Druig's conflict with whether he should end wars, and with Phastos feeling guilty over advancing Humanity's technology. I see what they were trying to go for with giving the characters more depth, but there were too many characters that it ended up feeling messy and incomplete. If they started out the Eternals' story with something smaller (i.e. making Thena the villain), then maybe they could spend more time building out all of the characters, but when only a few are chosen to be given incomplete backstories that lead nowhere, the movie is left feeling really messy.

I get what they were trying to do with the flashbacks, but a couple of them ran on for way too long and made the pacing feel off. This also wasn't aided by the fact that this movie took place in like 100 different locations so the movie felt choppy and all over the place to begin with.

I thought it was interesting how willing Eternals' was to kill off its characters. It was nice to see, as not very many comic book movies do that, but their deaths felt meaningless as the other Eternals didn't gain anything from them dying, and the plot was too overstuffed already so no one was shown grieving their deaths, apart from Ajak's. Ikaris' death was stupid. He basically just rage quit which was both unsatisfying and annoying as he was my favorite character. I'm curious if any of them will come back in the sequel or not.

The sex scene was so unneeded. It added nothing that wasn't already told in the scenes with Ikaris and Sersi prior. Why include it?

Something that I did enjoy was the visuals. All of the scenes with Arishem and how his scale was shown were very appealing. I also enjoyed how Makkari's speed looked. Every speedster looks the same these days so it was a nice visual refresh to see something new. Also, big props to Eternals for not doing a bullet time scene. Not even Sonic could get away without doing one. I also liked Richard Madden as Ikaris. He was probably my favorite performance of the movie, he plays the 'evil superman' role very well, even though it's a trope that is very overdone at this point. 

Dane Whitman felt useless, his relationship with Sersi didn't set up any problems with Sersi's relationship with Ikaris, which is really the only thing I could think of for why he would be in this movie. I suppose Marvel just wanted to set him up to be Black Knight, but again, this movie is way too overstuffed to begin with so he should have just been cut and saved for a later movie.

One last thing I take issue with is the frame of reference between the Eternals' powers. What makes someone more powerful than the other? 
What about Ikaris makes him more powerful than everyone else? Surely the girl who can change humans into water can best a guy who shoots lasers out of his eyes and flies around? Also while everyone else is using their powers to fight one another, Sprite gets knocked out with a rock. There is no frame of reference for how powerful these characters are.

Then, after the final battle, why are Sprite and Kingo welcomed back with open arms after turning on the other Eternals like one hour before? Are there no consequences for their actions? This isn't even mentioned once.

Despite what you may assume about the theatre attendance of a 10:30 am showing of a movie that came out nearly a month ago, it was actually pretty packed. This is usually the best environment to watch comic movies in, but not a single joke landed the entire movie and it felt really awkward sitting there knowing everyone is cringing.

In summary, Eternals bit off more than they could chew and left us with a movie that feels half-baked. They should have tackled a smaller story so more time could be spent fleshing out more characters. Some people got half of a backstory, and some got none. I feel like now that all of this groundwork has been laid, a sequel where all of my problems with this one could be fixed could easily happen, so I'm curious what the next step is.","w/dad, @ theatre",2021-11-27

It doesn't get much better than this. I could rewatch this movie every day until the day I die and never get bored with it. My only complaint is how plot-holey the MCU has been since the inclusion of the blip.

2021-12-01,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,2021,https://boxd.it/2kjJGl,3,,"65/100

Apart from the hefty VFX budget, Venom: Let There Be Carnage felt like a made-for-tv movie. It was a tight 90, had shitty pacing, questionable performances, cheesy dialogue, generic cinematography, and a cop-centered B-plot.

I don't think I realized Andy Serkis had as much style as he does. The quick cuts and camera pans, especially in the beginning, were a welcome surprise that added a lot of character to this otherwise flat movie.

I do not like Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock. Hardy is a fine actor, just not here. Hardy's attempts at shyness and timidness come off as awkward and flustered. I don't think this is the best character for Hardy to be playing.

I was excited going into this that I would only have to bear it for 90 minutes if it ended up being bad, but now that it's over, I wish it were longer. A lot of the scenes felt way too fast, and a lot of beats that I assume were meant to be emotional did not come off that way because of its runtime. 

The time between Eddie and Venom splitting up and getting back together felt way too quick; they barely even showed the characters missing each other. I also thought the time between the cop saying he killed Shriek and Shriek being revealed to still be alive was way too fast to feel like a twist, even though she was heavily featured in a majority of the marketing for the movie.

I appreciate Venom being made to feel like his own character. To the best of my memory, there weren't any scenes with just Venom, no Eddie in the first one, which is odd considering he is the titular character. The party scene was a fun bit, but again I wish the movie would have taken more time to emphasize how hard it is for Venom to find a suitable host. This would have made Eddie's realization in the finale feel more substantiated.

Speaking of the finale, I felt like the final fight actually held high stakes. I didn't read much about this movie before going in, so I had no clue how safe any of these characters really were. After seeing Kleetus' backstory in the first act, as well as how viscous the Carnage symbiote was, I wouldn't have been surprised to see the cop or Wendy killed off, or Venom badly hurt. One of the only fights in a comic book movie where I was genuinely concerned for the characters and felt real suspense.

I think this movie's runtime is its most detrimental feature. With an extra 15-20 minutes to lengthen a few of the scenes that felt too quick, I feel like this movie could have been a lot better.

As soon as I read the synopsis, I added it to my watchlist; films that manage to make a feature-length movie out of such a simple concept are so compelling to me. For this reason alone, Carnage did not disappoint. I love how each time the Cowans tried to leave, they were drawn right back in through the ringing of Alan's phone, and how they all took turns siding with each other before turning around and getting mad again. There was a nice progression for each of the characters through false contentment, true anger, drunkenness, and anger again. I also loved all of the little details that were added to the dialogue that made paying attention that more rewarding. There is a lot to love here, if you enjoy writing I highly recommend this, it's truly commendable what was accomplished here.","w/ myself, @ mu, sparrow",2021-12-01
2021-12-02,Last Night in Soho,2021,https://boxd.it/2krSUd,4,,"Honestly, unless I'm missing something, I don't see what everyone is on about when it comes to this movie. I've seen a ton of negative press but I have almost all good things to say about it. 

For the complaints I do have, I feel that it's a little lackluster when it comes to style. When you look at the Cornetto Trilogy which absolutely oozes Wright's style, and you look at this, Last Night in Soho feels a bit flat. Another complaint I have is how underutilized Ana Taylor Joy is. She's one of the better actors working today and I feel she wasn't given the right material to show off what she's got.

As for what I did like, the twist was fun but called for, the design of a lot of the horror elements felt fresh and fun, and the soundtrack was full of some of my favorites of the era. 

I wish there would have been a bit more of an exploration into what the ramifications of Eloise's odd behavior were, I feel like you don't try to kill one of your classmates and get away scot-free.

I'd definitely like to rewatch this again soon, if it's anything like Edgar Wright's other films, it only gets better each time you view it, so maybe I'll give it another go over Christmas break.

Edgar Wright is probably my favorite director working right now, and it hurts to see that not only has this been poorly received, but it's bombing at the box office as well. This isn't the first time this has happened to Wright, so hopefully, this doesn't discourage studios from allowing him to continue to make stuff like this.

The performances were poor for the most part, the dialogue felt awkward, and the look of the whole thing felt like an episode of a low-budget cop show. The attempts at jokes were futile, some of them didn't even register with me as jokes until after the fact, and the emotional beats were about the same. I liked the design for the wolf, but I wish there was a bit more of a reveal for him, and as for the killer, it would have been nice to have a little bit more background as to why he chose to be a furry to commit his crimes.

2021-12-04,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,2021,https://boxd.it/2kGR2f,3,,"Honestly, not as bad as I thought it would be.

Out of all of the things they could have done right, they nailed the sound design for some reason. Apart from Manny, everyone was cast perfectly. The voices and sound effects were exactly how I would Imagine them while reading the books as a kid, and the score perfectly fits the vibe of that imagination.

I noticed that some of the mother's lines sounded like they were recorded over zoom or something. I'm sure this was COVID-related, but it's very noticeable and feels lazy.

The animation is very high quality and looks good in that sense, but I hate how the characters look in 3D. The designs in the books were based on how Greg saw the people around him, so it doesn't really make sense for them to look the same in the real world.

It's weird that it's not even an hour-long, when this was first announced I imagined it as a feature-length movie. I wonder if the sequels that they've already announced will do the same thing. 

I am a big fan of the live-action Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies. I think I like the direction the first one went over how this one went, but if I'm not mistaken this one is much more book accurate. I think some of the emotional beats and pacing were done better with the 2010 movie, but they weren't necessarily bad here.

I'm not at all the target audience for this 'movie', and while I would have preferred a continuation of the original movies with the same cast, I guess this isn't all that bad. I'll probably watch the sequels just out of pure curiosity.

Not as good as the original movies, but miles better than that shit they pulled back in 2017

2021-12-09,The Adventures of Tintin,2011,https://boxd.it/2lqCvj,4,,"My brother and I used to love the Tintin animated series from the 90s growing up. We would constantly beg our mother to take us to the library so we could check out the next collection of episodes on DVD. Then, when this came out, we begged our parents every weekend for a month to take us to see it, which, thankfully they finally caved in.

Even now, some 10 years later, I still find myself entranced by the world of Tintin. I know deep down this isn't as great as I allow myself to see it (more on that later), but the opportunity to walk back in the shoes of my younger self and be immersed in the awe of this epic adventure is just too good to pass up.

Throughout my watch, I went back and forth on whether I enjoyed the motion capture animation style. The biggest pro is that the character designs would not have been as perfect as they are here had they been live-action, although I wonder what it would have looked like if they went the direction of something similar to Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse's animation style. 

However, I don't think Speilberg would have been able to accomplish the style of cinematography that he pulled off had it been any other medium. I didn't like the cinematography at first, but soon grew to love it. I usually look to Brad Bird when it comes to directing animation, and his technique is to only use shots that would be able to be done in live-action. This can usually add a level of realism to a movie where the animation is lacking, but after realizing that Tintin isn't supposed to be 'realistic' (i.e. the character design), it quickly grew on me. 

There are some really cool transitions while The Captain is retelling the story of Red Rackham's treasure, and there's a seven-minute one take in the third act that is absolutely nuts. If Speilberg went the route Bird usually does, he would not have been able to do any of these shots. Tintin's adventures are always far-fetched, so why can't the cinematography that captures his tales be far-fetched too?

I think Tintin's biggest issue is its pacing. This movie does not give you a single second to breathe in its entire 107-minute runtime. This unfortunately leaves most of the characters feeling half-baked. We have no reason to care for these characters, other than that they are presented as the good guys. There's one story beat at the end of the seven-minute one-take where Tintin has to choose between getting the scrolls he has spent the whole movie looking for or saving The Captain and Snowy. However, there was never a moment where I questioned the safety of these characters because of course Tintin would choose them over the scrolls. Changing Tintin for The Captain or even Snowy would have been much more suspenseful and would create a much more meaningful story beat.

Unfortunately, I think the sequel, The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun, is one of those movies that is forever going to be stuck in pre-production. Speilberg has insisted that it's still in the works as recent as 2018, and Jackson is not only set to direct the sequel but also has a clear schedule for the next couple of years, so it is a possibility that this pipe dream could become reality. The writer of Alex Rider wrote the script and the cast is all set to return so it seems like the stars have aligned for an even better sequel. I'm cautious to get my hopes up, but I can't help but be excited.

With a team of Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, Edgar Wright, Steven Moffat, and Joe Cornish, it's no surprise this movie was a success. I love a good action movie, and Tintin is absolutely no exception.","w/ myself, @ home, sparrow",2021-12-08

The fight scenes are so cheesy. The choreography is so sloppy. The writing is awkward and comes off as funny when it's not meant to. 

The villain is some random rich dude named Byron? He's not even someone from the comics they made him up just for the movie and has not been mentioned in any Spider-man media since.

The effect used for Peter's Spider-sense is the most 70s thing I've ever seen and that is not a compliment. 

It was written poorly, but Peter's monologue about it being impossible for Spider-man to have a normal life was a nice touch. It is an oddly human scene in an otherwise emotionally flat movie.

I hate that this has more Spidey POV shots than any MCU thus far. They're very rudimentary here, but they are very much appreciated.

I think I finally figured out why all of these movies feel so slow and impossible to watch; they're Peter Parker movies, not Spider-Man movies. He solves all of the crimes and persues the villains as Peter. Reminds me of that one Impractical Jokers segment where Q pitched ""Superman: Just the Clark Kent Stuff"".

We rarely see Peter suit up to defeat the villain, and when we do, it's to fight someone made just for the movie. Almost nothing besides Spider-Man himself is pulled from the source material. The villains are made up just for the movie and none of Spidey's classic side characters appear apart from J. Jonah Jameson. 

It seems like a lot of people loved this when they were children, and considering this TV show was the first widely available live-action Spider-Man, I can't blame them. But as a new viewer who is seeing these for the first time in 2021 after all of the spidey content we've gotten since, it seems to be impossible not to be underwhelmed.

Venom works much differently here than he did in the sequel. He's almost like Green Lantern in the way that he can kind of create any shape that makes the plot easier to write. It's a little too convenient and makes Eddie feel too safe as a character.

Venom looks a lot different than he does in the sequel. He's less expressive, feels more menacing, and has a different voice, all of which would have been useful here.

Eddie Brock's girlfriend dropped him way too easily. One of the many instances of poor character writing.

I like Anne's new boyfriend. His involvement creates an interesting dynamic between the three main characters plus he's actually likable. I wish they did more with that relationship.

A really odd critique but the sound design is really weird in this movie. A lot of the sounds don't match what I would imagine they should sound like. A lot of the sound effects with Venom sound too cartoony.

The final fight is so lame compared to the fight with Carnage. It's just two black masses lunging at each other while YouTube audio library action music plays in the background. No humor, no interesting character interactions, no fun.

All I've done this review is compare it to the sequel but I just watched it the other week and all I could think of is I think the sequel has a better grasp of what this franchise should look like. This feels so flat, while the sequel feels so stylistic and fun.","w/ myself, @ mu, sparrow",2021-12-11

Just an all-around good flick. The gold standard for comic book movies.

This is the best version of Spider-Man that we have gotten in terms of staying true to the source material. With the aid of Sam Raimi's directing, it really feels like every shot is stripped right from a comic book.

Dafoe is obviously the fan-favorite performance here, but honestly, Toby Maguire is perfect here as well. He plays Peter's internal conflict between sacrificing his normal life to fight crime or just settling down and being with the girl of his dreams perfectly. 

I love Sam Raimi's direction and editing style. This rewatch is going to be a treaat.","w/ myself, @ mu, sparrow",2021-12-11
2021-12-12,Tower Heist,2011,https://boxd.it/2lXh01,2.5,,"I love heist movies, and I love Matthew Broderick, so it only took me about 12 hours after I found out this movie existed to watch it.

My biggest complaint about this movie is the pacing. There were a couple of scenes throughout the movie that felt like they were cut short, or were abruptly ended by a joke when it felt like there was still more that needed to be discussed.

There are always two ways heist movies go. Either the group succeeds, or the group makes it look like they fail only to explain how they secretly succeeded later. Tower Heist takes the ladder, only they never explain how they secretly succeeded. They just show you that they secretly succeeded without explaining how. Therefore, one of the most satisfying parts of any heist movie is missing, leaving a gaping hole in the plot.

Another problem is how many loose ends this movie has. There were a bunch of storylines that were introduced but never resolved. The movie may have an end but the story feels very incomplete.

Is this movie racist? I honestly can't tell. There were definitely a few lines here or there that made me raise my eyebrow but it's hard to tell how purposeful they were.

Alan Alda sounds like Swaggersouls

I honestly had a lot of fun watching this. All of the characters were entertaining, the heist itself was a ton of fun, it's not the best movie but it's certainly worth the watch.","w/ myself, @ mu, peacock",2021-12-12

I forgot that this is when MJ starts to get annoying in these movies. That scene at the end where Peter is about to tell her that he loves her but she says it before he can is so annoying. Let Pete have his moment!

Alfred Molina is the perfect Doc Ock and Doc Ock is the perfect villain. I'm very excited to see him return in No Way Home.

This trilogy is so perfectly casted I swear. JK Simmons is so perfect as JJJ.

The special effects hold up incredibly well. Doc Ock's arms and the full CGI versions of some of the characters they had to use for some shots are indistinguishable from the real deal.

That shot where the New York skyline appears from Doc Ock's glasses is so perfect. Top 10 comic book movie shots for sure.

I had a hard time figuring out what about this movie people hated so much, but then I watched the second half. It seems like from the moment Peter first tries on the symbiote it's all downhill from there.

I get what they were trying to do with symbiote Peter but it just does not work at all. It's cringy and is barely even enjoyable even from an ironic/nostalgia standpoint.

I don't like the whole Harry coma thing. It feels messy and way too convenient.

It sucks that the studio had to interfere with this one. Raimi was on the verge of making a perfect trilogy. This isn't bad, but it just doesn't hold up as well as the first two.

I really would not mind a fourth one of these. If No Way Home ends up being really popular, which who am I kidding of course it will, I could see Sony trying to get the old crew back to make another. I love the concept that Raimi tried to go with back before they rebooted with Andrew, and I would really love to see John Malkovich as Vulture. Maybe an old man Spidey storyline of some sort? I have full confidence they could find an interesting story to tell.","w/ myself, @ mu, peacock",2021-12-12

This just really is not that good.

I don't like Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker. He's either way too awkward or overly confident. No in-between.

the Lizard is a shitty villain, the character design sucks and his motivation is poorly justified.

The only reason we care about Captain Stacey's death is because we know it will make Gwen sad. I don't think anyone cared about his character.

I liked the little mystery aspect of who Peter's dad was but it was short-lived so it doesn't really matter.

While I don't like his portrayal of Peter Parker, Andrew Garfield's Spider-man is my favorite. I like his quips, the way he thwips, even though the suit here isn't the best.

I like this depiction of Oscorp, although it is odd to have without any of the Osborns.

The writing is complete shit. 

Gwen is my favorite love interest out of any of the Spider-man movies. She has very fun chemistry with Peter and Emma Stone plays her perfectly.

The tagline for this movie is ""the untold story begins"" which might as well be ironic because Spider-man is far from being untold.

This is my 11th movie of the last two days so I apologize my review is not as high effort as they usually are.

This movie is so different aesthetically from its predecessor that if you told me they were done by two different directors I would 100% believe you. Which, as far as that goes, I like this aesthetic so much better. Brighter colors, better score; I think that's why it's such a shame the script sucks. 

Actually, sucks is an understatement. I honestly think this movie has one of the worst scripts I have ever seen. It's cringy, it's awkward, and it makes no sense. I think I rolled my eyes more at this movie than I have any other combined.

Jamie Fox is one of the best actors working right now, it's a shame he was wasted on this version of the character. I feel like a version of Mysterio would have worked better for this movie. Casting Jake Gyllenhaal or Matt Damon or someone would have been something different that I think this movie would have largely benefitted from. Plus, I feel like the villain was wasted in FFH, so I wouldn't mind a different portrayal of the character.

I hate the Phillip Phillips montage scene. The giant pegboard is stupid and I hate the song. 

The head doctor at Ravencroft is way too goofy and while I liked the Electro theme at the beginning, it keeps getting reused it and it's gotten old. 

The little b-plots with the airplanes and Aunt May in the hospital during the third act are so unneeded. It feels like one of those deleted scenes you'd see on youtube or hear the cast talk about. 

The itsy bitsy spider bit is so cheesy but I don't mind it nearly as much as how Electro gets hit with a car and is knocked out for a few minutes. There is no frame of reference for this movie. Electro can withstand being shot with a sniper rifle, go toe to toe with Spider-man, but then gets knocked out with a car? 

I think what pisses me off the most is that the performances aren't bad, it's the writing that's total shit. ""When you said Spider-man said no, you meant you said no"" yeah no shit Harry we aren't three years old. 

I love Spider-Man's theme in this movie. Hopefully, we get some kind of reprisal in No Way Home.

Credit where credit is due, Gwen Stacy's death was probably the one thing this movie did well. It has made me well up every time I've seen it and this rewatch was no exception.

I remember being so hyped at the Sinister Six set up at the end when I first saw this in theatres some seven years ago. It's too bad we never got to finish this trilogy, even though I doubt it would be any good, I would still enjoy seeing what they would have in store. I don't like that all of the villains just use technology, so hopefully, the MCU gives us more comic-accurate depictions of those characters. Also that Alicia Keys song over the credits is fire.

Opening with that beautiful web-slinging scene was such a tease. It's too bad everything besides those first three minutes was trash. (I'm ignoring the parent flashback. I'm happier pretending that doesn't exist).

The only reason I enjoy this more than its predecessor is style alone. It very narrowly beats it though. Like it's almost a tie. Bad movie.","w/ myself, @ mu, sparrow",2021-12-13
2021-12-16,One Hour Photo,2002,https://boxd.it/2mtf7X,4,,"One of Robin William's best roles. He plays the calm and lonely yet deeply disturbed so well I genuinely felt scared while watching him. The slow descent into madness was very well done from both a writing and an acting standpoint. 

The dream sequences were a nice splash of true horror in this otherwise slow-burn psychological thriller.

Great performances from everyone on the cast. I hadn't looked at the cast list before watching so it was fun to see some familiar faces pop up. It was not planned by the movie at all, but it was almost like I was seeing these familiar faces like how Sy saw the familiar faces from his photos.

There were some wild tone changes but I think they're supposed to be wild (?), so I won't hold it against them. The Humans is such a stupid name for this movie, it's way too basic. That's really my only complaint. The performances were phenomenal, I'd be surprised if this goes unnoticed for awards season. I love Beanie Feldstein as a person, but I hated her character here. Richard Jenkins is someone who has only popped up on my radar recently, I've liked him in everything I've seen so far and I'm excited to keep finding him in things.

2021-12-18,Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021,https://boxd.it/2mRJOP,4,,"My biggest complaint with how the MCU has treated Spider-man so far is how un-Spider-Man he feels. There's no Oscorp, no Harry, no Uncle Ben, and he goes to space to fight Thanos before ever getting around to asking out the girl he likes. However, this movie fixed that problem here and will continue to fix it moving forward, in what promises to be some of the best Spidey content we've gotten yet (more on that later). 

Another problem I've had with prior chapters of the MCU Spidey story is how flat they feel. I mainly attribute this to director Jon Watts, someone I presume Marvel hired by picking a name out of a hat of unsuccessful film students because the guy was in no way qualified to take on on a project of this caliber. However, Watts has started to redeem himself. Whereas Homecoming and Far From Home were the cinematic equivalents of gnawing on a damp washcloth, No Way Home introduces some much-needed style to the mix. We’re not talking Coen Brothers or Edgar Wright here, but the long one-shots, the split-screen effect during Peter and MJ's FaceTime call, and the dolly zoom during Peter's spidey-sense going off on Norman were all very nice touches and greatly appreciated.

The aspect of this film that I was the most worried about going in is that it would feel like a bad cocktail of Avengers: Infinity War and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Infinity War, while mildly enjoyable, features so many characters that it has no option but to jump from plot point to plot point with no time to breathe. There are very few emotional beats throughout the film and it leaves you feeling like you're being used as a superhero speed bag for 149 minutes with no water break. Then there's The Rise of Skywalker, a movie I loathe with every ounce of my being, that retroactively ruins prior installments of the franchise so the audience can feel nostalgic towards a poorly written pile of shit. However, much to my surprise and enjoyment, Spider-Man: No Way Home dodges both of those bullets and delivers the perfect equilibrium between heart and fan appeal. Jon Watts, you have my respect for that one.

Diving deeper into how that was accomplished, I think it can be mainly attributed to the increased screen time of the side characters. Compared to Homecoming and Far From Home, this movie feels more like a Peter Parker movie than a Spider-Man movie. Rather than spending screentime building the villain, the movie spends time building Peter's relationships with Ned, MJ, and Aunt May. This is to great success, had any of these characters died in prior installments of the franchise, it would not have warranted the same reaction it got out of me here.

In a similar vein, the performances from Peter and these side characters were the best we have gotten from them so far. Marissa Tomei was great in every scene she was in, but especially killed it (no pun intended) during her death scene. I was unfortunately spoiled that May wouldn't make it through the movie, but even having known that it still got me to well up a bit. Furthermore, I think the performance Zendaya gave here was the best I've seen from her. She perfectly depicted MJ's anxious, yet comforting personality, and having recently gone through heartbreak myself, I'd be lying if I said her line delivery during the finale didn't break me down faster than two toddlers playing a game of Don't Break The Ice. 

As for the villains, I feel like Willem Dafoe was slightly too over the top during the Goblin scenes for my taste, but I understand that that was the purpose of his performance so I can't complain too much. Alfred Molina was my favorite of the bad guys, he killed it just as well as he did it 19 years ago when he gave one of my favorite CBM performances to date. Jamie Foxx gave a vastly different performance than his appearance in TASM 2, which would be something I wouldn't mind if it weren't for the fact that his character creates a gaping plot hole in this movie's plot. If only people who know Spider-Man's identity were teleported to this universe, then why didn't Electro know Peter was white? I might have missed a detail somewhere, but that stuck out like a sore thumb to me.

I know people don't really consider J. Jonah Jameson as a Spider-Man villain, as he's more of a side character than anything else, but I do like how he's portrayed as the sixth member of the Sinister Six here. My only complaint is that it's odd how Jameson has to shoot his newscast in front of a green screen in his basement, yet can afford helicopters and multiple news vans.

I kept going back and forth as to whether I liked the visual effects. The fight in the mirror dimension was very well done, but the way The Lizard looked when he spoke was so jank. I loved that Peter's spidey-sense was visually shown with the waves around his head, but I hated how Doc Ock's arms were any length that was the most convenient and just materialized out of his back. The shots where they were extra long looked so goofy and took me out of the movie.

Now, the elephant in the room, the peck of pickled Parkers. In my opinion, Toby and Andrew were used perfectly. The insight into their current lives as Spider-Man answered questions fans have had for years while making it an emotional beat that didn’t feel too fan service-y. The finale was obviously a hoot; seeing those three swing around The Statue of Liberty and interact with each other was a dream come true. The scene at Ned's house where Andrew and Tobey first emerge had my jaw on the floor for a good five minutes. Seriously one of the best uses of fan service I have seen in any movie, ever. The best possible way that could have been pulled off. 

The other bit of fan service that I nearly forgot about was Matt Murdock's appearance. This didn't do as much to me as it did to others considering I haven't seen the show, but it was a fine addition nonetheless.

I am a very large fan of the ending. It sets Spidey up for a soft reboot, gives us a chance at a more Spider-Man-like Spider-Man in the MCU, and could offer some of the best Spidey content yet. If they're giving the same treatment to Daredevil, hopefully, we see him in future projects where the two team-up. The new suit is beyond perfect, and I am very excited about the next trilogy; I just hope they get a different director. 

The post-credit scenes were fine. Having the symbiote coming from the venom-verse feels a little convenient but I’ll let it slide. The MOM trailer looked great, I’m glad Raimi is back doing what he does best, superhero and horror movies. The visuals look great, although I’m hesitant to see the continuation of what felt like the multiverse dilemma being wrapped up in a neat bow. If the Multiverse continues to be a problem past MOM, it's going to feel too gimmicky so hopefully, it's put to rest permanently by the end of that. Also, the inclusion of what-if characters is a rabbit hole I don’t want the live-action MCU to go down, so I'm a tad anxious towards that plot point. 

Will this movie's inevitable success (probably the first billion-dollar movie post-COVID) inspire the return of Toby and Andrew in their own movies? I hope so. We’ve got at least 3 years before the next trilogy starts, and Sony has to make money somehow so I could definitely see it happening. In the meantime, I’ll look forward to Spider-Man: Freshman Year. 

In conclusion, Spider-Man: No Way Home is easily the best Spider-Man content we have gotten since the Raimi trilogy, and is only aided by the great performances and a perfect balance of heart and fan service that only promises more greatness to come.

Actors really signed on to be in this. And a studio really gave the money to produce this. The number of people I have seen pour their heart and soul into scripts and never see them get made, the number of YouTubers I watch that ooze talent on degrees far higher than the people behind The Change-Up could ever dream of having, it's truly sad that we live in a world where shit like this can get made and things by truly talented people cannot.

At first, I thought that this was one of those ""ha-ha-horny"" movies made for 13 year-olds to watch at sleepovers, but I feel like even a horny teenage version of myself would hate this movie. There are so few redeeming qualities from this movie. I like Ryan Reynolds, I love Jason Bateman, and it hurts to see them waste their talent in this. Jason has shown that he can play funny in Arrested and has proven his skills as serious in Ozark, surely he has more confidence in himself than to act in stuff like this?

It's not just the main actors, too. Olivia Wilde is amazing in House, M.D., and it hurts to see her with anyone besides Jason Sudeikis, so it's a shame she's in this too.

The Freaky Friday genre is a genre of movie that has gone relatively unchanged since its birth and I think it's time Hollywood finally buries the hatchet on this one. Not a single Freaky Friday movie has brought something new to the table, and while there have been a few entertaining installments along the way, this certainly is not one of them.

Probably my favorite of the Disney+ shows so far, it feels grounded, but not too messy like TFatWS.

Episode One (3 Stars) - 6

The acting is stiff and the writing is awkward. The opening scene was cool but I'm unimpressed so far.

Episode Two (3 Stars) - 5

I like the idea of a murder mystery but it's not very well done thus far. The script feels like a rough draft.

Episode Three (3 1/2 Stars) - 1

There was less dependence on dialogue and performances, eliminating my issues with the first two episodes leaving me to actually enjoy this one. The action scenes were fun and well-choreographed. Kingpin!

Episode Four (3 1/2 Stars) - 2

I loved the little relationship-building moment between Clint and Kate to Mele Kalikimaka. Some of the line delivery from the background characters was a little awkward, but that's my only complaint about this episode. I hope we see more of Yelena than what we saw of her here. Bert and Bertie clearly know what they're doing, the two episodes they've directed are my two favorite episodes Disney+ has put out for Marvel so far. Hopefully, they're handling the rest of the series.

Yelena is annoying. More Kingpin!

Episode Six (3 1/2 Stars) - 4

Hopefully, Bert and Bertie are brought back for future projects. They felt like the only ones who really knew what to do with this show. Also, considering how many people died in the Battle of New York, Rogers: The Musical is essentially the same as making a musical about 9/11.

He spends a majority of his time talking about COVID, which probably would have made me laugh more if it weren't for two of my close family members testing positive today. I try to have a good sense of humor about everything, but I have been anxious out of my mind since I found out leading that topic to be spoiled for me.

2021-12-25,Don't Look Up,2021,https://boxd.it/2obM0d,2.5,,"There is so much movie here. The runtime is over two and a half hours, but I feel like I just watched a mini-series. In my opinion, that would have been the preferred medium for this story as the vibe reminded me of other Netflix mini-series like Space Force or Living With Yourself, and it somehow felt like too much for a movie while still leaving crucial story beats out. Plus, I probably would never have watched this if it were a series as opposed to a film.

I wouldn't say that I wasted my time watching this, as there were a few things that I enjoyed, but it doesn't exactly leave a good taste in my mouth. The stand-out feature are the visuals in my opinion. The VFX look beautiful, genuinely some of the best I've seen all year, and the bright colors are a very welcome touch and offer a nice juxtaposition to the overall dark theme of the movie. The only thing I couldn't get behind was the atrocious opening credits. Again, the colors were appreciated, but it came off like a jumbled incoherent mess. Perhaps this is a reference to the plot of the movie, but I think I'm reading too far into it.

Another aspect I enjoyed was the music. The cheery, almost child-like tone to the score reminded me of sitting on my couch watching Noggin as a child. This I assume was a deliberate reference to the dreariness of the plot, and it was very welcome.

As much as I enjoyed those aspects of the style, the cinematography and editing fell flat on its face for me. 

The performances were another nice treat, for the most part. Leonardo DiCaprio was a ton of fun and bodied his role, which made for easily one of my favorite performances I've seen from him so far, on par with his in The Wolf of Wall Street. Otherwise, I just found a majority of the cast annoying. I understand that the point of the supporting cast was to be annoying, but I think it went too overboard. Everyone is too stupid for their own good, and goes past the point of delivering a point, and ends up being detrimental to the movie. Every cast member is stupid in their own way and ended up frustrating me in one way or another.

I understand that that is the point of the movie and that it's supposed to be a commentary on society views global crises or something, but I think it's one of those instances where it doesn't need to be said because the people who are watching this are the people that the situation is already made aware too. Yes, it's annoying that people are stubborn about COVID regulations, but do you really think that someone will watch this and suddenly come to that realization? In my opinion, that is too high of an expectation to have and ultimately makes the film feel meaningless.

Adam McKay is known for his comedies, which is rightfully so. However, Don't Look Up doesn't offer much comedy. I appreciate the writers not stooping as low as to include the style of humor as Step Brothers and company, but the jokes were too few and far between for me to be able to comfortably call this a comedy. Also, any movie to have a ""you've been meme-d"" sequence is instantly receiving backlash from me. That has never once been funny and I doubt it ever will.

I called the ending from the moment Maryll Streep's death was revealed and while that usually makes me feel proud of myself, it just ended up feeling like picking low-hanging fruit. As for the scene right before that, I'm glad that it went the way it did, as it would have felt all too convenient for it to go a different direction, but I was still left unsatisfied.

At surface level, this movie works really well for me. Sure, it's probably one of the campiest movies Marvel has put out, but the score, music choice, and story are all very fun and very well done. However, the second you start to peel away at the layers, Far From Home starts to crumble under its own weight. 

It has the huge responsibility of acting as an epilogue to Endgame, but it asks more questions than it answers, and the ones it tries to answer, just avoids the question by making half-assed attempts at comedy. 

Then there's Mysterio's master plan. I always find it hard to critique the use of technology in blockbusters because there's no frame of reference and I, therefore, can't call something ""unrealistic"". However, the usage of drones and holograms in this movie jumps that shark too much for me to ignore. With the sheer scope of Mysterio's operation, it's a shock that he didn't lose a projector earlier. Plus, any attempts at making this technology more realistic were only done so through made-up words and even more far-fetched explanations.

Ned and MJ feel so underdone here. Maybe I'm spoiled after seeing No Way Home (which handled them perfectly, by the way), but I feel like they are pushed to the side more than they should be. Peter's interest in MJ feels so half-baked. He has barely interacted with her yet has this elaborate plan to confess his feelings? It's accurate behavior of a high schooler, sure, but I don't think it translates well to film. 

I really like Ned and Peter's dynamic. Peter fights the crime while Ned serves as the ""guy in the chair"", or at least that's what we're told. We saw it happen at the end of Homecoming, but we didn't see it once here. I think they joked about it more than it actually happened. We haven't seen very many iterations of Peter Parker where his best friend not only knows he's Spider-man but helps him solve the crime, so I wish we got more of that.

One thing I do like is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. At first, I wasn't a huge fan, but then I realized that he's playing someone who is trying to act (and probably can't all too well), and that's when it worked for me. It's by no means his best performance, but it works well nonetheless. I really hope his character comes back in some capacity down the line.

Hear me out, while I was expecting a lazy rehash of one of my favorite movies of all time, I ended up watching something that acted as its own thing where it needed to be, but still played plenty of homage to the original. I enjoyed the appearance of Buzz, and the nods at Kevin were fun too. Sure, the plot is absolutely ridiculous, the performances are cringy, the look and style are god awful, and not a single joke landed, but they did not pull punches on the trap montage and that's really what mattered to me here.

My only ask is just don't try and make this a franchise. The original Cris Columbus movies are still beloved by millions every Christmas, there is really no reason to remake something perfect if it continues to appeal to audiences year after year.

Not only is Firework by Katy Perry played once, but it's played twice over what is essentially the exact same scene. I'd say about every fifth joke landed, but I will admit that scene with king Julian and the bear riding around on the unicycle got a chuckle out of me. Much more trains than I remembered.

I wouldn't say I'm the biggest fan in the world of this technique, but the performances more than make up for it. Joaquin Pheonix and PSH both body their roles here, I understand why Joaquin was cast as Joker, I feel like there are hints of Arthur Fleck in Freddie Quill.

One thing I didn't quite get was the cinematography. There were some beautiful shots, and there were some shots that felt lazy. A bunch of the solo shots of Freddie had something in the foreground, and while I don't totally understand why that would be, I'm just proud of myself for noticing it.

However, as the film goes on the camera work gets more and more gimmicky, making what we were seeing feel unrealistic because of how it's supposedly being recorded.

The first two acts are a lot of fun, I think Trank really nailed what three high schoolers would do should they suddenly get superpowers. Their chemistry was believable and all of the performances were pretty decent.

I don't think the twist that came at the third act was necessary, it felt a little out of place and I feel like it was only written into the movie because they didn't know what to do with Michael B. Jordan in the finale.

I haven't been able to take Mark Wahlberg seriously since I saw Andy Samberg's impression of him on SNL and that streak very much continues here. I get that he kind of looks like the real guy but they couldn't have gone with someone like Matt Damon? 

I always love John Malkovich and it felt weird to be forced to dislike him here. Not to mention his accent sucked, I would have rathered them go for the inaccurate approach and just have him use his regular voice.

As for what I did like, I always appreciate it when movies based on true events use real footage. It wasn't utilized as much as I had liked, it would have been interesting to see the real news footage inter-spliced throughout the movie and not just the end, but the closing tribute to those who lost their lives was a nice touch.

2022-01-13,10 Cloverfield Lane,2016,https://boxd.it/2tmM9B,3.5,Yes,"10 Cloverfield Lane does so many things right. Written by Damien Chazelle and produced by Matt Reeves and Drew Goddard, it's no surprise this movie got the critical success it did.

I think the best part about this movie is how it does so much with so little. As a matter of fact, I think it's the small scope that really allows for that tension, suspense, and anxiety to build within the viewer. This claim is only backed by how uninteresting the last 10 minutes are. I think by ending the movie right when Michelle sees the alien ship for the first time, we would get both the satisfaction that Michelle had escaped, as well as the dread that came with Howard being right. With the ending as long as it is, that emphasis is kind of lost, and Michelle choosing to fight rather than hide doesn't feel as satisfying as both of those realizations would.

There are some neat camera tricks utilized here. In the scene where Howard finds Michelle's suit, the camera is constantly framed around the air vent where the mask is hidden. This shows emphasis on that particular object rather than the characters, as well as gives it a larger presence in the scene, therefore making the viewer more anxious as to whether Howard will see it. Then, once Michelle escapes, the camera is often put inside of her mask, up close to her face. It was a cool way of emphasizing Michelle's anxiety in the scene as well as added some visual variety to the movie as a whole.

John Goodman really outdoes himself here. He plays the unstable, questionably trustable, grizzly middle-aged man very well. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also does a great job, playing the uneasy, always anxious prisoner, complimenting Goodman's character perfectly.

Apart from the last 10 minutes, this is essentially the perfect thriller movie. You don't really know who is good or bad, there are constant twists, it's a slow burn, great acting, great writing; I could go on and on.","w/ myself, @ mu, youtube",2022-01-12

I think I was spoiled by the fight sequences in the first two because I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed here. The one fight scene that did take place inside the matrix, the final fight, featured that iconic cinematography and special effects, but the fact that it took place in the rain made it feel very messy and overstuffed.

2022-01-14,The Matrix Resurrections,2021,https://boxd.it/2tEkyz,3,,"When I first heard this movie was being made, I was immediately worried that the charm of the original's visuals would be lost to the advancements in CGI. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the visuals in this movie were beautiful, it just didn't feel like The Matrix.

For example, I loved the way Morpheus looked in Zion. It was unlike any effect I had seen before and has me confused as to how they pulled off that ""nanobot"" effect. The one effect I didn't like, however, was the choppy motion blur effect that was used on NPH during the bullet-time scenes. I get what they were going for, and while it's cool in theory, the execution was just poor. I kept thinking my computer was lagging, which isn't exactly something anyone finds cool

Making the original trilogy a video game within the universe of this movie was a very meta and very bold idea and I respect them for doing it. However, at least to me, this only felt like an excuse to revisit all of the locations of the original felt like that classic sequel trope of ""hey remember when you guys liked this? Well here it is again!"" and ends up feeling unoriginal and rehashed. It's a cheap reinvoking of nostalgia that will always tank my rating of the movie (unless you're Spider-Man: No Way Home, they actually did this really well in my opinion).

However, I will give it to Lana Wachowski, that video game pitch scene is the perfect slap in the face to the Warner Brothers after essentially forcing her to make this movie. It was a not-so-subtle nod that I'm surprised made the final cut.

As much as I love the guy, Keanu Reeves really is just a pretty face. He was fine in the original trilogy, but he kind of sticks out like a sore thumb here. His performance wasn't great, and for all of the scenes that took place in the side of the matrix, he literally just played himself. I wonder if he had some sort of contractual obligation to keep his hair long for John Wick: Chapter 4.

On the other hand, Neil Patrick Harris was a treat; I haven't seen him in a whole lot but he plays this ""sly evil"" very well. As for the replaced characters, I loved Yahya Abdul-Mateen's take on Morbius but I wasn't big on Johnathan Groff's Agent Smith. It wasn't a bad performance, I just wasn't a fan of it.

There are about 40 minutes in the middle of the movie that are just purely exposition. I Found myself bored and ended up taking a Twitter break during that scene and had no trouble understanding the rest of the movie so I'm going to go out on a limb and say it could have been cut. Also, the fight scenes felt like they were on a much smaller scope compared to the originals. I don't know why I had my expectations set so high, but I think I just assumed if they were going to revive the franchise some 17 years later it would have topped the prior installments in some aspects.

Sure, it was fun to spend another two hours in the world of The Matrix, but I hope they don't do anymore. When it boils down to it, all of these movies are the same, and I think this is the last one I can take before I start to get bored.

2022-01-15,Hotel Transylvania: Transformania,2022,https://boxd.it/2tNbAJ,2,,"I wrote a 1000+ word review of this movie and accidentally deleted it so I apologize if this review comes across as messy or poorly written but I simply cannot bring myself to spend any more time watching or critiquing this sad excuse of children's entertainment.

While this feels like the proper next step for the franchise, it was a huge step back in terms of quality. I actually didn't mind the third one, it had a great soundtrack and the premise wasn't completely lacking. However, this movie flops in both of those categories. The throwback music was replaced with ""monster parodies"" and the other opportunities to play songs were filled with lame royalty-free dance music. I assume this was done in an effort to limit spending, but I guess I hoped that would still be something that made the cut.

Speaking of budget cuts, both Adam Sandler and Kevin James were recast for this movie. They were the anchor stars for the first three so it sounds weird in theory not to bring them back but I honestly didn't mind. The guy that plays Dracula essentially just does an Adam Sandler impression and kills it, and while the guy that played Frankenstein did his own thing, I can't picture Kevin James' voice so it didn't really matter to me. Jim Gaffigan plays the crazy scientist and while the character himself didn't do or say anything that made me laugh, picturing Gaffigan in the recording studio making that voice tickled me funny.

There were a few story beats that I couldn't behind. The fact that the monsterfication ray had a built-in GPS was all too convenient, the fact that Johnny progressively got more crazy felt like a weird direction to go, and the monsterfication ray gem leaking into the water fountain just felt like a very forced way to get the rest of the cast into their human forms.

I'm curious where they'll take the franchise next, if anywhere, but I doubt I'll watch it if they do. Also, why is Ninja in this?

I think Patrick Bateman only sees what he wants to see. I think he is so messed up in the head that he can gaslight himself into thinking that his fantasies are real.

Christian Bale's performance is insane. There is not a single moment in this entire movie where he didn't deserve an Oscar.

I did not completely understand the performances last time but I have certainly learned to appreciate them after this viewing. All three of the main cast are impeccable. I think Danny's is the most commendable performance, obviously due to his age, but Jack and Wendy are both very well done as well. Last time I felt that the performances were too over the top, almost to the point of being cheesy, but I see now that that is the point of these characters and only adds to the charm of this movie.

The only part I couldn't take Jack seriously is when he was walking up the stairs asking Wendy for the bat. All I could think of was The Simpsons parody and I started laughing.

The first act feels a bit slow but that's the point. It's the ""slow burn"" of this slow-burn horror, with the third act serving as the bomb at the end of the wick. 

I love the crash zooms in the third act. The cinematography was all pans statics and tracks up until that point so it was some nice visual variety to emphasize what was going on.

There really wasn't any ambiguity or confusion until the third act. I have Yogi Bear to thank for inspiring me to seek out more information on how to interpret this movie. I'm glad I did, as there are a ton of small details that Kubrick included that I definitely wouldn't have noticed. It's nice when both the casual and the eagle eye viewer can be rewarded.

I had a hard time deciding whether I want to rate this four or four and a half stars, and while there is so much that I can appreciate about this, there's still a bunch of stuff that just isn't entirely my cup of tea. 

I found myself bored during Dick Halloran's side plot, as he kept pulling away from the storyline I was actually interested in, but the stuff I was interested in, my eyes were glued to the screen. 

I also didn't like how lazy the graphics looked. Yeah, sure, it was made over 40 years ago, but Kubrick made space look real over 50 years ago so I feel like he could have picked something a little better than uncentered white sans serif on a black screen.

I can appreciate how unique and effective The Shining's score is, but I just didn't find it very pleasant to listen to. This is by no means the film's fault, it is very well done, I just didn't find it very appealing.

I'm glad I gave this a second watch. Both because I can finally stop being bullied by my friends for reviewing it poorly and because I now have a more confident taste of one of the highest-rated movies in my mouth.","w/ myself, @ mu, hbomax",2022-01-18

The performances were surprisingly great. I was expecting them to draw from the Jim Cummings side of things and feel like more of a student film, but I was poorly mistaken. Everyone acted their asses off, which probably ended up being one of the bigger twists of the movie.

Speaking of performances, I did not realize the detective was played by Johnny Depp until I checked the cast list. I'm not kidding when I say my jaw hit the floor. The prosthetics and performance were insane here.

There were some fun cinematography tricks here. It's nothing groundbreaking, but it was enough to stand out and make the film feel a little more visually pleasing.

However, Tusk is not without its issues. I feel like some of the dialogue-driven scenes ran a little long, and the plot is handed to you on a silver platter multiple times to the point where said dialogue scenes feel repetitive.

I feel like stoner comedies like these end up being a convoluted mess of tones and themes but Tusk actually pulls it off. It's not perfect, but I'm not sure how a movie about a man being turned into a walrus could be. ","w/ myself, @ mu, showtime",2022-01-23

I would praise the director for also writing, starring, editing, set dressing, and composing this movie, but I found out shortly after finishing that he got arrested for beating up his girlfriend (which is ironic considering the plot of this movie) so I am going to keep that to myself for the moment.

There is much more to this movie than just those things, it just takes a bit for those other things to come into play. But, once they do, Free Fire becomes a ton of fun. The colors, the dialogue, the cinematography, the stunts, it all just makes for a solid movie.

This is probably one of the biggest casts I've seen in a single location movie. I enjoyed all of the characters equally and wanted them all to survive, making it a shock when each of them slowly got picked off. I don't know whether it was all of the beards or 70s glasses, but everyone in this movie looks like Seth Rogan.

The scratchy saxophone(?) that's used in the third act is a nice auditory touch. This movie didn't have much of a score apart from the ending but that's all it really needed.

I imagine this film was a pain to edit; a majority of the shots in the warehouse look near identical.

The constant gunfire is fun but it doesn't allow for as many character beats as I would have liked. There are some really fun characters in here, they just need some space to breathe.

It was not as horrendous as I thought it would be, but that's not saying much. A majority of the jokes got a laugh out of me, but not for the reason you'd probably think. I think what's so enjoyable about the original Airplane, the one that this is supposedly a remake of, is the visual comedy. Which, Airplane Mode actually did pretty well at honoring. The rest of the jokes (or lack thereof) that made me laugh were your basic inappropriate, over-the-top, vine humor. However, I didn't laugh because I found what they were doing funny, I was laughing because the concept of that type of humor making it into a feature-length movie was too absurd for me to not just laugh at it. The remaining jokes that were racist, involved sex, or in some way related to 9/11, and did not make me laugh but instead made me cringe to the point where I considered turning this off.

Any other aspect of this movie besides the aforementioned jokes was complete and udder ass and is an embarrassment to the Airplane franchise. There is a reason internet stars shouldn't be in movies.

All of the character arcs are complete within the first 60 minutes and then the rest is just everyone running around having fun. I thought i was watching the conclusion and was confused to see that I was only 45 minutes into this 1 hour and 45-minute long movie.

Impressive animation from a first-time studio, but the story lacks big time. I feel like the whole ""technology bad, real life good"" plot has been very overused in kids' movies. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 did it, The Mitchels vs. The Machines did it, and while these are all different movies, they feel very similar and left me bored here.

Cheers to Zach Galifinakis for getting a couple of good laughs out of me. I feel like Ron is a clear copy of Baymax from Big Hero Six, but the ""mindless robot just following orders"" bit is better done here from a comedic standpoint.

The text bubble on-screen bit is so overdone and made me annoyed to see it here. That's really my only complaint though. The trip scene made me cringe very hard but I don't know if that was the point or not so I'll ignore it for the time being.

I genuinely believe we are witnessing the beginning of a Jenna Ortega renaissance. She was very good here and it seems her career is only getting started. Great performances all around. Julie Bowen who I have only seen as Claire Dumphy in Modern Family was a nice surprise here as well.

I really don't have a lot to complain about but it still doesn't feel like anything higher than a 3.5. Not sure why I feel this way.

This feels very unscripted. A lot of the dialogue is just the main three mumbling over each other and is played off for laughs. It's not funny in the slightest and gets very annoying very quickly.

The story structure reminds me of a Family Guy episode. There is no common sense or sensible trajectory. Each plot point has no connection to the one before it and the places the characters start is so different from where they end up and that the movie just feels messy and convoluted.

There is so much blatant racism, and its not even funny. It just felt like the writers wanted to be racist because they felt like they could. There were a bunch of jokes that just felt wrong to listen to.

Chris Pine is the only redeemable performance in this movie, and he absolutely kills it. I don't know what this genre of character is called, but I absolutely love it. Kevin Spacey was great too, but he's always great and I have a hard time speaking highly of him so I think I'll stop my comments on him here.

There were some cool visual effects when the crew first moves into the warehouse and when they plan out their heist but that's as far as any semblance of interesting direction goes.

The sexualization of women is such a cliche in these shitty comedies and it always comes off as cringy. Jennifer Anistan's existance in this movie is disgusting more than anything else. Rape should not be played off as a joke.

I do kind of get upset with myself when I pick a movie I know is going to be shitty over something that's very highly rated but at the end of the day I'm not scrolling through TikTok and I am actually learning something valuable from criticing them so I can't be too upset.","w/ myself, @ mu, hbomax",2022-02-08

Pushing Dead isn't anything special from a filmmaking perspective, but damn did that line hit hard.

From a technical standpoint, this was shit. It crossed the 180-degree rule a couple of times, something I haven't actually seen happen in a studio-backed movie, so it was quite jarring.

I've had this film on my watchlist for ages, Psych is my favorite TV show of all time (tied with Arrested Development), so I was curious to see James Roday Rodriguez in some other roles. I think he was fine here, I definitely think Shawn Spencer is more his forte, but he wasn't total trash. 

The writing is the stand-out feature. A lot of the little comedy bits were really well done and just the dialogue all-around was solid.

And while that may leave most audiences bored, I really enjoyed it. Fargo is meant to be a character study.

However, much to my pleasure, watching Jackass Forever in the theatre offered a far better experience than I ever would have gotten had I just watched it in my dorm like the others. Being able to laugh and gag and flinch along with everyone else in the theatre was an amazing theatre experience, one of the better I've had. 

There was something noticeably different about this installment, it felt more ""put together"" somehow. I feel like the first three just felt like a bunch of dudes running around with camcorders doing dumb shit; this felt more like an actual production and less of a shitty VHS your local skate shop would play on repeat on the store TV. I attribute this to everyone being sober for the duration of filming. I kind of like that they did that, it made the stunts and then the reactions to the stunts feel more genuine. 

Which, speaking of, they really brought their best this time around. Jackass Forever has some of the gnarliest stunts of the whole series. Funniest, too. I really don't want to spoil anything, as I think this is a movie that is best experienced without any preparation, but it is so worth the watch.

See this in theatres before it's too late. It's an experience you won't forget. I hope they don't stop making these.

To get two whole movies about you being tall, I feel like you'd have to be really tall. Like abnormally tall. Like 6'5+ at the smallest. But no. This bitch is 6'2. That is two inches taller than me. Do you know how many people I see on a daily basis who are two inches taller than me? So many. And none of those people deserve movies. They should call this ""uninteresting girl"" or ""lmao we got you to watch a second one of these girl"".


I hate that cliche sequels do where they just make the side characters have a romantic relationship out of nowhere.

I can't tell who we're supposed to be rooting for. Most of the protagonists are dicks and most of the antagonists are written in a way that we sympathize with them. It feels conflicting.


The cinematography is overly stylistic to the point where it feels bland, something that I wasn't aware that was possible and doesn't entirely make sense.


At the end of the day, this movie carries a good message; be confident in who you are, it just picked a very strange way of getting that across. They should've made a movie called ""Short Guy"" and it's just Wee man from Jackass living out the exact same plot as this movie and they just never acknowledge that he is 48 and probably shouldn't be allowed in a high school.


To end on a high note, I did genuinely enjoy most of the directing. The performances are good, like 50% of the jokes landed, and this really wasn't a terrible direction to take a sequel. They fixed a fair amount of the problems that people had with the first one but unfortunately caused more in the process. There really is some good stuff here. It's unfortunately overshadowed by the rest of the movie which happens to be shit. I can't complain too much, considering I will most definitely be watching a third one if they make it.

The movie started out weak which caused me to not care about the characters for the remainder of the movie. I really only stuck around for Rasputin and the promise of more Matthew Vaughn directed action sequences. 

There were so many of those ""they referenced something from the last movie isn't that cool?"" and the music would sound like it did when it was said the first time and it just felt cheap and like low-hanging fruit.

The score and VFX are great here. The entire third act is, while a tad overlit, beautiful. I was hoping we'd get a fight scene to Rasputin by Boney M but alas we did not.

It's no doubt Matthew Vaughn is a good director. He mixes absurd violence and action with subtle comedy and always leaves you with something unique. However, that doesn't make him invulnerable to making bad movies; even with his signature flair, The King's Man felt flat and uninteresting. 

I'll be back for Kingsman: The Blue Blood, The King's Man sequels, The Statesman movies, and whatever else Fox wants to greenlight because it seems they love Vaughn at the moment (not a complaint, I love him too).

The route that was taken to make Deadpool pg-13 is very creative, I'll give them that, but I feel like making the movie as a part of a storybook makes it feel less grounded. This format worked fine for a lighthearted movie like The Princess Bride, but it makes the important story beats of Deadpool 2 feel less important. This movie tries to tackle the death of a loved one, but any attempt at emotional depth is lost to the format that the story is being told. 

The style of humor that's featured in Deadpool movies just isn't for me. The non-clever references to pop culture feel like low hanging fruit and the attempts to be self aware come off as more annoying than the things they're trying to be self aware about. This is a critique on the franchise as a whole, but unfortunately that includes this movie too.

This movie has the format of a Family Guy episode. The character's objectives at the beginning of the movie are not the same by the end of the movie.

It's the same music that was used in Lego Batman: The Video Game which is a game that my brother and I played endlessly as kids. It brings back so many good memories and holds so much nostalgia for me that I can't help but smile every time I hear that classic Batman theme.

That being said, this movie is pretty mid. There seems to be more Bruce Wayne stuff than Batman, and the Batman stuff that is in there fails in comparison to what's been done in other Batman interactions since this movie's release. Sure, it was great for its time, but so was OJ Simpson so I don't feel too bad about rating it poorly for that reason. 

Jack Nicholson gives an incredible performance but the actual character that is the Joker is kind of stupid. He fell into a vat of chemicals, turned white, and just started trashing art museums because he wanted to (get vaccinated, kids!). Where did he get the resources to do the things he does here? It's a stupid plot hole to point out but when a movie takes itself this seriously I feel like you need to have your bases covered.","w/ myself, @ mu, hulu",2022-02-28
2022-03-02,Batman Returns,1992,https://boxd.it/2CJWcd,3,Yes,"I always thought Tim Burton was an odd choice to direct a Batman movie but upon rewatch I understand why he's actually perfect. Tim Burton's version of most of these characters works really well for me. I think it's a problem when Batman is the least interesting character in his own movie, but I'm willing to waive that complaint due to how perfect the villains are. I would have loved to see a Poison Ivy or Scarecrow in Burton's style. Too bad we got Batman Forever instead.

Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny Devito both kill it in their roles. Both were equally my favorite parts of the movie. Some of the better performances in Batman movies, and are heavily underrated in my opinion.

The fight choreography is embarrassing here. That fight between Batman and Catwoman in the warehouse is laughable. They would've dealt more damage to each other if they had a thumb war.

The plot is stupid. Penguin runs for mayor and then tries to steal all of Gotham's children because... he didn't get to be one? And then he tries to blow up the city with a bunch of Penguins with missiles strapped to them? That sentence sounds like a Madlib. If it weren't for Burton's style, I would have guessed this was another Schumacher film.

I watched the Burton films after I watched the Schumacher films and it's honestly quite sad to see what this franchise turned into. In an era of reboots and long-awaited sequels, maybe we'll finally get that Batman Continues many of us have been waiting so long for. With Keaton reprising his role in The Flash and Batwoman, it's really not too far-fetched.","w/ myself, @ mu, hulu",2022-03-01

It was not as tense for me this time around but that's only because this is my second time watching it and I remembered everything that happened pretty well.

2022-03-03,Solaris,1972,https://boxd.it/2CYxEh,4.5,,"Solaris is one of those movies that you have to watch a Youtube video about directly after to understand. I picked up on a couple of things, but I'm glad I had it explained to me because the themes that are explored here are just as unique as they are thought-provoking. It tackles so much but lands every shot it takes. I'm going to be thinking about this movie for a while.

The cinematography, the score, and the use of colors are all stand-out features to me. The music is mesmerizing, but it's used sparingly, giving it an added touch of significance each time it's used. The colors are so drab yet so vivid (one of my favorite color palates in a film to date), and the use of black and white was a bold choice but a good one. The cinematography remains calm when things get crazy, but gets crazy when the story stays calm. It's a simple filmmaking tactic but an effective one. The set design is phenomenal as well. It reminds me a lot of 2001: A Apace Odyssey, which this movie is somehow more confusing than.

It seems arbitrary to say, but Solaris is a solid watch. It's a little hard to get through at times, as it likes to meander around the plot a lot, but it's totally worth it in the end. Sometimes I just wish good directors liked conciseness as much as the bad ones do.

The performances are noteworthy too. They were given a perfect script, so they had a lot riding on their shoulders, but the cast nailed it. Even with all of the dialogue in Russian, I was able to feel every emotion that was conveyed, something that I can't always say about watching foreign films.

This is one rewatch away from a five-star rating and an addition to my Infinite Rewatchables list.","@ theatre, @ mu",2022-03-02
2022-03-04,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",1987,https://boxd.it/2D1ctt,3,,"I completely understand why this is the classic it's seen as, for the most part. The performances are the saving grace here. John Candy and Steve Martin play off each other beautifully and they nail every joke the script gives them. Easily my favorite bit here is the entire sequence on the highway, with my favorite line being, ""how does he know where we're going"". My dad quotes that all of the time and it never fails to amuse me.

Despite all this praise, this movie has some glaring issues. There's a part of me that wishes I wasn't the critic I am because I really wish I could just sit back and enjoy a fun movie, but the editing was some of the worst I've ever seen. There were always glaring continuity issues, and the cutting back and forth between the main plot and Steve Martin's family back home was always awkward and jarring. Which, that whole subplot as a whole felt unneeded. The reunion at the end didn't feel very special anyway, this movie was never about Steve Martin getting home, in my mind it was always about him learning to be less of a scrooge, so it felt tangential and distracting to include the actual family.

Anyway, join me next time where I ruthlessly pick apart a piece of pop culture that does not deserve it because I cannot help but be hypercritical of every piece of media I consume. Bye for now!","w/ alaina, @ mu, paramount+",2022-03-02
2022-03-04,Let Me In,2010,https://boxd.it/2D4Ipf,3,,"Super solid opening. Caught my attention right away and gave me a great reason to continue watching.

The CGI is a little wanky but the kills are absolutely brutal so I don't take any issue with it. If there's one thing this movie delivered on, it's kills and gore. The shock value is high with this one.

The script falls off around halfway through. It goes from mediocre to total shit. The movie goes from a dark mystery thriller to a less dark romance. My interest significantly decreased after that shift.

What I've learned from watching the Planet of the Ape sequels and now this is that Matt Reeves is a good director but keeps getting stuck with shit scripts (even though some are his own). The cinematography, colors, score, and performances across all of his recent movies prove that to me.

Some thrillers (take Parasite for example) hide details that only become apparent on repeat watches, making it worthwhile to see them again. But alas, Se7en had nothing to hide. I think some of the clues that John Doe left are a little too vague and the conclusions that the detectives draw are a little too far-fetched. I attribute this to suspension of disbelief, as Se7en is a little too grounded to let this slide. Despite all of this, the ending is what pulled it all together for me. From the moment John Doe turns himself in to the moment the credits roll, Se7en really proves why it's rated as highly as it is. I wasn't completely sold on the rewatch until that part rolled around. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey are all excellent in the finale.

2022-03-07,Sex Appeal,2022,https://boxd.it/2DJ1B5,2,,"Last January, I woke up to the sounds of firetruck and ambulance sirens coming from the office complex across the street from me. I couldn't see any fire, but I couldn't fall back asleep due to how curious as to what unimaginable horror could have possibly warranted this many first responders. I walked downstairs, put on my winter coat and boots, and snuck out my back door. I quietly and hastily made my way over to the complex, only to talk to one of the firemen and learn that a faulty alarm had gone off and that the situation wasn't all that bad. I had a very similar experience with this movie. I saw the trailer, brushed it off as total trash, but ended up finding something that definitely wasted my time but wasn't as bad as previously thought.

My biggest issue with this movie, apart from the fact that it is unbearably awkward, is that it promotes very unhealthy relationship dynamics. It features characters being pressured into sex, trying to detach emotion from sex, and gaslighting each other. Clearly, this movie's target audience is horny teenagers who have parental controls on their phones and can't just look at porn (I would have loved this 6 years ago), so it feels irresponsible to include these themes and present them as an okay thing to do.

The main character, who we are supposed to believe is hyperintelligent, doesn't pick up on basic social cues, and doesn't even have a basic understanding of human reproductive organs. Is the main character autistic? Not a complaint, this could be the case, but due to literally every other aspect of this movie I'm pretty sure it's just shitty writing.

On the flip side of things, I enjoyed all of the allegories and analogies used, this movie actually has a pretty good sense of humor when it joked about anything besides sex (which wasn't much).

Matt Reeves is a great director; he’s proven that across all of his projects. However, he just isn’t as talented of a writer, yet he continues to collaborate with himself time after time. Reeve’s writing has continually been the root of the issues I’ve had with his films, and <i>The Batman</i> is no exception. 

The third act is where this movie falls off for me. The plot to flood the city comes out of nowhere, the Riddler’s henchmen felt like they were only there to act as Batman’s punching bags, and the Riddler’s social media antics felt too gimmicky. I think if there had been a few lines sprinkled throughout the first two acts about the flood walls, say during Thomas Wayne’s Renewal pitch or perhaps a line dropped by Alfred, the introduction to The Riddler’s plot would feel far smoother. 

A common complaint I’ve seen is how this version of Bruce Wayne doesn’t feel like Bruce Wayne. And while I agree, I think it just allows for character development down the line. We saw the start of that arc here, with Bruce learning how to balance Batman and Bruce Wayne, and I’m glad he didn’t completely figure it out yet so there’s more to do in the inevitable sequels.  

I really enjoy Matt Reeve’s direction. Not only is this my favorite take on Batman as a character (he’s actually a detective!), but it’s my favorite take on Batman as a franchise as well. It’s grounded, well shot, and the score and casting are perfect. Every character in this movie is my favorite take on the character; The Penguin, Falcone, Catwoman, The Riddler, and Gordon are all perfect. I like how a lot of them are set up to return in future installments. I will welcome them with open arms just as long as they don’t take the place of characters we haven’t seen yet. I am craving a good Man-Bat, Killer Croc, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, etc. I think they would all fit well in this universe, so I can’t wait to see what Reeves has next.

2022-03-12,Taxi Driver,1976,https://boxd.it/2EEstr,3.5,,"I was very on board with this movie until about the 75-minute mark. Everything up until then was near perfect. 

Robert De Niro's performance is flawless; I love the little facial expressions in reaction to other characters' lines. Travis is an addicting character to observe and was the only reason I continued to watch after the unpreferable shift in narrative. 

This has a great script, one of the best Scorsese has worked with. Very dialogue-driven and has a couple of clever bits of humor.

The score reminded me very much of the Between Two Ferns theme song. Apparently, I am not alone in thinking because when I tried to post my parody <a href=""https://youtu.be/x5HG7ScUqxY"" rel=""nofollow"">Between Two Lamps</a>, YouTube tagged the video as including the Taxi Driver theme. It's not a bad score, it was just way overused and got old very quickly. 

I feel like all of this movie's momentum was lost after Travis's failed assassination. Travis still got what he wanted, it was a very redeemable ending, but it was achieved in a way I wasn't totally on board with. 

That being said, the final action scene is very well directed, apart from the odd shift in colors. 

Taxi Driver would be an easy 4.5 if it continued on the trajectory that was set up by the first 3/4 of the movie. I'll definitely revisit this again just for that first 3/4.

From the moment I started this movie, I knew that this wasn't meant to be watched on a laptop. This was meant to be watched in a theatre, surrounded by an audience. It's sad to see Disney screw Pixar over like this. It makes sense for Disney to drop a dull and uninteresting movie like Raya and the Last Dragon on Disney+, but dropping a high effort, quality movie like this feels so backhanded to the company that has given them some of their best movies of the last two decades. 

I've always said that a good animated movie uses its medium to achieve things that a live-action movie couldn't, and Turning Red does just that. Text on the screen that interacts with the characters is something I seldom enjoy when I see it in live-action, but I loved it here.

The animation is beautiful. Pixar continues to amaze me with their animation, I can't imagine hand animating smoke or water or tufts of hair. Insane.

This worked for me more than it didn't, but the places where it didn't work are glaring issues in my opinion. The lesson of ""be proud of who you are"" is such low-hanging fruit and was disappointing to see here. Obviously, it's an important lesson to learn, but so many other movies have already tackled this and with so much originality being found in this movie it's sad to see its main theme be recycled.

Just a lot of fun. Probably the most Pixar thing Pixar has made in a long time. Please stop dumping these on Disney+.

I'm tired of Ryan Reynolds playing the same character in every movie he's in. His ""humor"" is just writers giving him unfunny lines and expecting audiences to find it funny just because it's him who's saying it. Spoiler Alert: it doesn't work. Young Adam pulled off a really impressive Ryan Reynolds impression but unfortunately, that means that he's just as annoying. This is the first movie I've seen with Zoe Saldana where her face wasn't hidden behind makeup and I've gotta be honest, she isn't as good of an actress when she isn't hiding behind prosthetics.

The visual effects are great from both an art direction and an execution standpoint in all but two places; the Sorian particle accelerator interior and the Cathleen Keener de-aging. The action scenes are shot in a fun way and the fight choreography isn't bad either.

It was refreshing to see the stakes of this movie be pretty small. Most time travel movies involve ""the fate of the world"" or ""the risk of destroying the timeline"" so it was nice to just see it relate to self-love, regret, and paternal relationships. The theme could be better executed, but it's just nice to see it be more emotion-driven than most time travel movies.

Speaking of time travel, this movie didn't spend too much time trying to explain how time travel works but it didn't need to. The explanation it did give just used a bunch of big science words that I assume were meant to make the audience go ""I don't understand this, so it must be true"" which is kind of frustrating but at the same time how do you explain time travel so I'm not too torn up about it. The ""time will course-correct itself"" explanation kind of felt like lazy writing, especially with how all of the characters just conveniently remember exactly what they need to remember in order for the events of the movie to actually make an impact on their lives and make the story come full circle.

Probably Shawn Levy's best movie, but that really isn't saying much. It's an enjoyable, well-paced, (kind of) emotion-driven movie that delivered on what it sent out to do. A very good ""family movie night"" movie.

Just as a side note: it's interesting how I was able to tell that this was a pandemic-shot movie. The cast is relatively small, and a good amount of the scenes were either shot on green screen or in a remote location. The scenes that did require a large crowd was shot very tightly so only a few people were in frame at a time. This didn't take away from the movie, but it is very interesting to me that I noticed; I'm curious to see how many more movies I'll be able to tell were shot during a pandemic with this in the back of my head.

The performances from both Pattinson and Safdie were impeccable, I wish they both got more recognition for their roles. The script is a huge stand-out feature; I love how anxiety is depicted here. Connie getting overwhelmed by the constant barrage of noise in both the scene in the Bail Bonds place and Ray's apartment were so well done. The character arcs that Connie and Nick take are so satisfying yet leave me wanting more. Holds suspense very well. Genuinely just a solid movie.","w/ myself, @ mu, showtime",2022-03-18

I see a lot of people complaining about the blatant racism in this movie but I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be. To me, we’re meant to find it funny that the guy thinks he can get away with saying something that racist, not what he's actually saying.

Hot take but I'm not bothered by the age gap. usually, toxicity occurs when someone older in a position of power takes advantage of someone who thinks they have no choice but to listen to them. That doesn't occur here, the younger one has just as much power in the relationship and there's never an unfair power dynamic shown.

One of those weird cases where the trailer is better than the actual movie. A coming-of-age movie set in the 70s with Life on Mars playing over the trailer? It's a shame it wasn't what the trailer set it up to be.

I wish less time was spent with Mark ""things would have gone differently if I was on that plane"" Wahlberg because he is easily the least interesting character in this movie.

Great soundtrack. Tons of iconic 70s hits. Livin' Thing by ELO over the credits? Perfection.

Boogie Nights doesn't tackle any deep themes or anything, it just observes a group of characters for a period of time and is very entertaining to do so.

Started out slow but I liked it more and more as it went on. Lots to love here.

I've already written a pretty lengthy review and my thoughts haven't changed much since my last viewing so I just want to take a moment to commend the marketing that went into this movie. 

If there was an Oscar for best trailer, The Batman would easily take the cake. Every trailer had me hyped beyond belief, each one of their compositions was perfect. I also love how they included riddles into the marketing; hiding messages in posters and trailers, allowing fans to have something to work on while they waited for its release.

Anyway, I'll definitely be watching this again once it drops on HBOMax. In the meantime, I'll build the Lego sets for this movie that I just shilled $110 on😁😁😁","w/dad, @ theatre, XD",2022-03-21

2022-03-25,Adaptation.,2002,https://boxd.it/2H822n,4.5,,"I have never related to a movie on as deep of a level as I did Adaptation. I was so lost in Kaufman’s words, and I felt so heard by the struggles he was going through. The fear of disappointment, the longing for purpose, the innate need to fit every possible human interaction into the mold of a screenplay. The first hour and a half of Adaptation. are five star material, and I was ready to rate it such. 

However, the film takes an unpreferable turn in the final act. It makes sense, so much sense that I have a hard time critiquing it because it’s hard to fathom any other possible ending to the movie, but I just didn’t like it. I wanted more of that raw emotion, and I was left empty handed.

I like the struggle with wasted potential and disappointment. Maybe this is a result of me trying to force myself and my problems into every movie I watch, but I couldn't help but see a bit of myself in Will. To have the bases loaded and to strike out; not a concept I'm a stranger to.

The story drags a tad in the middle but my attention was kept with the scenes with Ben and Casey Affleck. I liked the coming of age aspect of this movie, and their chemistry is contagious.

Performances are the stand-out feature but that's no new observation. Dialogue is really solid too.
