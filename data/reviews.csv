2020-07-29,Minority Report,2002,https://boxd.it/1gYZBz,3,,"The concept for this movie is interesting at first, but after watching I realized it’s just too ambitious. Also the “futuristic” setting felt extremely forced. Mediocre acting also didn’t help. Still not a bad watch due to the interesting plot.",,2020-07-28
2020-07-29,Get Out,2017,https://boxd.it/1h3lLT,5,,"Best movie I’ve ever seen. From the deep plot to the fitting social critiques, it all just works together perfectly.",,2020-07-29

2020-09-08,Nightcrawler,2014,https://boxd.it/1lhWn9,3,,"A few days after watching this, I still can’t tell if I hate Lou because I’m supposed to, or if I hate him because he reminds me of ben shapiro impersonators. I liked the concept of the movie, Lou and other characters left me feeling confused at the end",,2020-09-04
2020-09-08,Parasite,2019,https://boxd.it/1lhXnp,4.5,,"Before watching, I had high expectations but at the same time I had a feeling I was going to be disappointed. Nothing about Parasite ended up being disappointing, it has almost everything you could want out of a great film",,2020-08-07
2020-09-09,Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,2019,https://boxd.it/1lo8tb,3,,"Besides an amazing atmosphere and an unexpected ending, there's not much that I enjoyed. Brad Pitt's performance was the only one that stuck out to me. I appreciate how subtle this film was compared to the rest of Tarantino's work, but it went too far with that for it's two and a half hour run time",,2020-09-07
2020-09-09,Us,2019,https://boxd.it/1lrtSx,4.5,,"Somehow this movie incredibly manages to be so deep yet so straightforward at the same time. At the surface, it can be a typical horror plot of hunter/hunted, but deeper down it can tell a story of psychological trauma. Great performances, atmosphere, and foreshadowing coupled with the genius story make for an insanely good film",,2020-09-08
2020-12-29,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,2018,https://boxd.it/1xLv4R,4,,First superhero movie I’ve enjoyed in a long time. Also has an amazing art style so there’s not much more I could ask for,,2020-12-28

2021-08-18,Free Guy,2021,https://boxd.it/24I2qF,1,,"The kind of movie that hurts to watch, meanwhile your parents are sitting next to you laughing the whole time. It's also incredibly ironic how the plot is about people who's indie game was ripped off by a big studio, but the entire movie is a cheap ripoff of the concept ""what if we made GTA a movie????"". Please don't punish yourself by watching this",@theater,2021-08-17
2021-08-19,Baby Driver,2017,https://boxd.it/24OVRD,4.5,,"The first half felt super deliberate, I loved the attention to all the little details. The second half wasn't much different, but I couldn't pay attention to the little things because my heart was pounding and my hands were sweating. Keep in mind that I was laying in bed, just watching this on my phone. This movie did an incredible job of sucking me, it really made me care. Thank you reed for the recommendation :)",,
2021-10-24,No Time to Die,2021,https://boxd.it/2emM2Z,3.5,,"I didn’t feel super invested in it, but that’s kinda my fault for not watching any of the prior daniel craig bond movies. A fine action movie overall, but I think I’ll appreciate it more if I watch the first four. Probably won’t do that since I watch roughly 1 film every 2 months, but let’s pretend I will",@theater,2021-10-24

2021-11-23,The Shining,1980,https://boxd.it/2j3IVD,4,,"Although a bit long and slow paced at times, I was still fully invested the entire time. The camera work, colors, lighting, sounds, all of the little things added together so well and it all felt so deliberate. Excited to watch some more Kubrick",,2021-11-22
2021-12-26,Die Hard,1988,https://boxd.it/2ona4Z,3.5,,"Didn’t live up to all the hype, but the bar was probably set way too high. Still a lot of fun to watch and im glad i finally did.",,2021-12-25

2022-01-15,Batman Begins,2005,https://boxd.it/2tWE3d,3.5,,"My brain has been beaten down by marvel so it was nice to see a superhero movie that wasn’t that same formula. That being said, it still struggled to balance Bale’s origin story with the Scarecrow narrative. 

At the very least, Batman Begins cleaned the bad taste that Tenet (my most recent Nolan film) left in my mouth.",,2022-01-15
2022-01-16,1917,2019,https://boxd.it/2udFaX,3,,Not bad in any way but really just not for me. The bleak war setting combined with the continuous shot concept really made it just feel dragging. Still not bad though just from the visuals and atmosphere,,2022-01-16

Besides that, there isn’t much I can think to say that hasn’t been said over and over. Simply a Nolan masterclass.",,2022-01-21

kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory”

Going into my third rewatch with this in my head  made me understand the ending much better. I picked up on a lot of little details throughout as well, and the actions of Pat Bateman just felt more understandable, in a twisted sort of way. 

I could watch this over and over and still pick up on new little things every single time. Masterclass",,2022-01-28

2022-02-18,Midsommar,2019,https://boxd.it/2AEEed,4,,"There’s so much going on here that it’s hard for me to get a grasp for it all. One thing I know for sure is that the visuals were impeccable. The sheer contrast of peaceful, wildflower fields and inexplicable gore is such a bold contrast but it works oddly well. Would love to watch again to pick up on some more plot details but I don’t think I can subject myself to that again.",,2022-02-18
2022-02-20,Hereditary,2018,https://boxd.it/2AZZAr,3,,"Unfortunately, this made me feel more disappointment than fear. I was fully invested in the slow build up and unwinding of the family, but the satanic cult reveal was underwhelming and confusing. I can appreciate the attempt at a carefully crafted story along opposed to an overload of cliche horror themes, but the focus on the plot sabotaged the ""twist"" of an ending while leaving me without any real fear. 

Hopefully it will all come together on a rewatch, but that won't be happening anytime soon.",,2022-02-18

Then I looked at it simply as the portrait of a “wise guy” life. The good and the bad. The successes and the struggles. Looking at it like this made me appreciate it for just what it is.",,2022-03-06
2022-03-06,Tenet,2020,https://boxd.it/2DA6g9,2.5,,"I can’t believe I still think about Tenet when I only saw it once roughly a year and a half ago. Something about it i just can’t seem to escape. Maybe it’s just such a facade. A blockbuster that seems to have much more to it than what’s there. 

Thank you reed for (1) seeing this with me initially and (2) continuing to engage with this confusing concoction of a movie with me to this day. Hopefully in the future I won’t wait 540 days to review things",@theater,2020-09-12

2022-03-10,The Batman,2022,https://boxd.it/2Ehv7x,4,,"This was the highest my expectations have been for a movie in quite some time, and I'm happy to say I was satisfied. While not perfect, it was still a good new take on the character and it did a solid job of finding its style.

This feels like the most natural version of Batman: dark and stripped back aesthetic, detective style, and not too many toys. Still not sure how this compares to the Nolan trilogy overall (not sure that it even matters), but I do enjoy the style of Bruce Wayne and Batman in this film.

My biggest complaint is that the start felt a bit too slow, but it is an almost 3 hour movie. Also, very disappointed about that “<a href=""https://twitter.com/lecinephiles/status/1488493409790672898?s=21"" style=""-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">bat playlist</a>” tweet not panning out into anything.
