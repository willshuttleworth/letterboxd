2020-11-05,Jim Carrey Ranked,,https://boxd.it/97Wgi,"Man do I love me some Jim Carrey. He's a huge inspiration to me and is easily one of my favorite actors. The list is ranked by how I like the movie as a whole, not Carrey's performance (if they were by performance every film would have a 5-star rating)."
